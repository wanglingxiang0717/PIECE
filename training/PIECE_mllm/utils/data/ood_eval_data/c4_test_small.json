    "text": "The sport of Bocce Ball is alive and well in Holliston.\n\"Throwing balls toward a target is the oldest game known to mankind. As early as 5000 B.C. the Egyptians played a form of Bocce with polished rocks. Graphic representations of figures tossing a ball or polished stone have been recorded as early as 5200 B.C. While Bocce today looks quite different from its early predecessors, the unbroken thread of Bocce’s lineage is the consistently common objective of trying to come as close to a fixed target as possible.\nFrom this early objective, the basic rules of Bocce were born. From Egypt, the game made its way to Greece around 800 B.C. The Romans learned the game from the Greeks, and then introduced it throughout the empire. The Roman influence in bocce is preserved in the game’s name; bocce derives from the Vulgate Latin bottia, meaning boss.\nThe early Romans were among the first to play a game resembling what we know as Bocce today. In early times they used coconuts brought back from Africa and later used hard olive wood to carve out Bocce balls. Beginning with Emperor Augustus, Bocce became the sport of statesman and rulers. From the early Greek physician Hippocrates to the great Italian Renaissance man Galileo, the early participants of Bocce have noted that the game’s athleticism and spirit of competition rejuvenates the body.\nIn 1576, the Republic of Venice publicly condemned the sport, punishing those who played with fines and imprisonment. And perhaps most grave was the condemnation by the Catholic Church which deterred the laity and officially prohibited clergyman from playing the game by proclaiming Bocce a means of gambling.\nBocce frequently lost and gained popularity throughout the ages. It was Giuseppe Garibaldi, who, while unifying and nationalizing Italy, popularized the sport as it is known today. In 1896, during a resurgence of popularity, the first Bocce Olympiad was held in Athens, Greece. Bocce has been a part of international sports ever since.\nThanks to many Italian immigrants at the turn of the century, Bocce has come to flourish in the United States. During its beginnings in the U.S., there were as many versions of the game as there were towns the immigrants had left. The popularity of Bocce in America has been on the rise since then and there are more than 25,000,000 Bocce enthusiasts throughout the United States today.\"\nNext to Soccer and Golf, Bocce is the third most participated sport in the world and is considered the oldest know sport in world history.\nAl Scaramella hosted the game that I attended. This day there were enough players to field two teams of four, one throwing red balls, the other green. Teams are determined as each player pulls a red or green ball out of a sack. Green always goes first.\nThe game starts with a member of the green team tossing out the Pallino, the small orange ball being thrown by Joe, above, who then rolls his green ball as close as he can to the Pallino. Red then tries to get closer to the Pallino than the green ball and each member of the red team rolls until a red ball ends up closest to the Pallino or all four reds are no closer than the green. Green gets to go again if a red ball ends up closer to the Pallino.\nAbove, the next ball to be thrown would be green since the red ball ended up closest to the Pallino. Capiche?\nAs in most sports, form is everything. Above Tony Alexander displays his form developed over years of playing bocce, starting \"when I was only this high\" said Tony with his hand waist high.\nHost Al Scaramella was just as effective using the same form as Tony. Both showed the results of years playing bocce.\nStrategy plays a big part in the game. Sometimes it's better to hit the ball of an opposing team than try to get close to the Pallino. The boards can also be used to position a ball behind the Pallino.\nAbove, Kevin tosses early in a game as Dennis, Tony, Aaron and Walter wait their turn. Tony and Al usually were anchors for their teams as it becomes important not to hit a ball of your same color and loose a point.\nSometimes a measurement has to be taken to determine which ball is closest. In the case above, one red ball is clearly closest but if the second red ball is closer to the Pallino than the green ball, then the red team gets two points instead of just one. Capiche?\nBetween games. Al Zambonis the court. Al built the court about four years ago and has been honing his skills ever since. Most remember when Bertuccis opened in 1984 or 85 with a Bocce court in the middle of the dining room. The court didn't last long for whatever reason.\nFirst team to reach 11 and is ahead by at least two points wins. This day the green team won every game even though there were different players each time.\nThere is at least one other Bocce court in Holliston. Teams and tournaments could lead to a shot at the Summer Olympics. Perchè no?\nI think this is fantastic. I played when I was a kid. Would love to be able to join a league in town.\nInteresting article, thanks. Would be great to see a bocce court installed at Blair Square near the rail trail!\n\"The court didn't last long for whatever reason.\"\nI think I should take some of the blame for the demise of the bocce court at Bertucci's. When it opened, my son was about 5. Bertucci's was a great place to take the kids (still is) and my son loved the bocce court, especially throwing the balls. His form wasn't as good as the pros, and occasionally, one of his throws went \"out of bounds\". I suspect there were other parents who failed at juggling waiting in line and making sure the balls stayed on the bocce court. Anyway, what goes around, comes around, and the offender is now 36, and expecting his first child in a few weeks.",

    "text": "A month ago, India had commissioned world’s first 100 percent solar-powered airport in Cochin. Recently, India’s greenest airport terminal at Chandigarh international airport in Mohali was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nBuilt by Larsen and Toubro (L&T), the terminal, spread over 53,000 square meters, is designed in accordance with concept of green building. The terminal sets a new benchmark in sustainability by incorporating various green technologies.\nThe terminal is constructed using over 55 lakh fly ash bricks and features cavity walls, double insulated roofing, energy efficient chillers, and a sensor-based plumbing system to save water. Such an extensive use of fly ash in construction of large structure is highly commendable.\nThe terminal has achieved a 4-star GRIHA (Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment) rating.\nUnlike other terminals, this does not have huge displays that run on artificial light and consume huge amount of electricity. Absence of displays has helped in cutting down maintenance costs and running expenditures.\nThe terminal does not require artificial lighting during day time owing to a transparent façade. Used glass on the façade is low-heat gain glass, which means it will automatically reduce the need for installing and spending on air conditioners.\nA lawn laid out right inside the terminal delivers a refreshing treat for passengers.\nThe available air conditioners are equipped with sensors that can detect body heat for automatic activation. Rest of the time, the ACs remain in sleep mode to save energy.\nTo meet the electricity requirements, a 200 KW solar plant is installed on the rooftop of the terminal. Solar plant generates enough energy to meet the major power needs of the building.\nFor lighting during nights, 40 percent of the airport is illuminated with energy-efficient LEDs.\nThe terminal also includes a sewage treatment plant with a capacity of 600 KLD. The treatment plant is based on environment-friendly extended aeration technology. The recycled water is reused for flushing and gardening.\nThe airport terminal is one of its kind in India, may be in world too. It hasn’t received any name yet, but most likely it is to be named after Indian revolutionary freedom fighter Sardar Bhagat Singh. The new airport will facilitate neighboring states including Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir.",

Lucky you!\nLucky indeed, Caitlin. When we walk out among the buildings adorned with coats of arms, strolling the city’s labyrinthine lanes, I have to pinch myself that I’ve been in such a special city for over a month. The friendly people here make Trogir all the more wonderful.\nJen, I agree with you that perpetually sunny skies can get a bit overwhelming. I felt the same way this past fall, visiting sunny Nevada. Sometimes I just yearned for a rain cloud or two. I suppose the “grass is always greener.” I liked your line that once again the “blue skies hold magic” for you.\nSome great looking up shots, Tricia. Love the one between the houses, with the lamp in, and that cat shot is wonderful.\nThanks, Jo! We do a lot of looking up here because a lot of the fun details are hidden up there.\nTricia I so loved your blue skies today. It has been the usual 300 days of rain followed by a day of sunshine. This is the rain-forest area so we must accept the rain but right now I do believe I have webbed feet. V.\nSoon you’ll be admiring all the emerald beauty around you!\nThose date palms set against blue skies is something to be cheery about. What a beautiful place to choose for home away from home. How long is this stay?\nLynne, I didn’t know that those were date palms! Thanks for providing that botanical tidbit.\nWe’ll be returning to Germany/France in May or June. (We can only stay in the Schengen Zone for 90 days at a time.) Since tourist season will be picking up here in the coming weeks and months, we’ll probably flit on off to another home away from home. There are so many lovely options – Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania? Another spot in Croatia? We’ll see. I am sad at the thought of leaving Trogir, though, as we’ve met some really kind people and are starting to feel a bit like locals.\nTricia Mitchell is spending some time in Trogir and exploring Dalmatia and she has written some very interesting posts, which are recommended reading!\nThe blue skies are a striking background for all your beautiful photos. Everything looks good against a clear blue sky! My favorites are the flags.\nHi Marilyn, blue is such a regal color – fitting for Trogir’s magnificent architecture! I also find the Croatian flag to be quite striking, especially contrasted with that column and centuries-old buildings.\nMark, I have to pinch myself whenever I see so much vibrant life here, even during these late winter months.\nI am pleased to find you via “Our Adventure in Croatia”. Stunning pics!\nTina, the feeling is mutual. Thanks for your flattering feedback and for visiting! In what part of Serbia do you live?\nI live in the South East. Near Nis. We are kinda distant neighbors.\nIndeed :) – we might be heading that way – we shall see. So much to explore in this region! How long have you lived there?\nThis time it is a long term stay. (maybe permanent.). We only just arrived in Nov (2012). But we were here two previous times for 5 months each tip. I am getting my bearings. :) Very Challenging with a toddler!\nWow, I can imagine how it must be challenging navigating new customs with a little one! Are you speaking multiple languages to your child?\nYes, but she cannot speak yet. In time she will be bi-lingual.\nAh, beautiful Tricia, croation skies are different than californian skies ,I can see. Enjoy!\nI’ll have to read up on why the color varies so, Cornelia. The winter light is of course quite different here on the seaside than in Germany.\nThe winter side is usually more bluish,, and the place where you are is usually more yellowish and reddish, talking in photography terms. It all depends on the temperature and the reflection of the sky, just a simple explanation so far.\nI wonder why that part of the world has such intense blue skies! The puzzled cat and the soaring seagull are my favourite picks Tricia.\nI thought that too, Madhu. I’ll have to ask my meteorologist friend.",

    "text": "Congratulations, this is no B.S. free zone!\nVisual artists are visual thinkers! So we made anatomy books for artists. They don't want to read magnificent, but boring anatomy textbooks, stuffed with medical level information.\nInstead, the author made a book with clear images, that contain only the necessary information needed, to create a realistic human form.\nMost pictures in the book are self-explanatory. The text part of this book is only about 2%.\nThe concept of this book came from co-author Uldis Zarins, classically trained sculptor, with 20 years of sculpting experience, looking for good visual anatomy book for his students, that would help to explain the forms of the human figure. After years of fruitless searching, Uldis decided to roll up his sleeves and take one for the team. So, he embarked on an epic quest to create a book for solid anatomical reference for any aspiring artist.\nThe book contains images of various examples of different postures, such as a twisted torso, the movement of arms etc. This means you don't have to guess anymore how each muscle will look from any angle.\n\"A secret weapon\" to making a realistic human form.\nWhat sets apart good classical artists from others? Major factors are the skills and practice of course, but good live model makes a huge difference! If you have a good reference, you won’t need a live model anymore. Be inspired, and don’t waste your precious time on the search for images in google, basically, everything you need is in this book!",

    "text": "The more times your children go under general anesthesia but it's not. This will be the 3rd time one of my children gets to experience this. It's really not that big of a deal, but I just feel bad there is nothing I can do to help, watching them wheel them away on the bed screaming, and then bringing them back asleep and waiting for them to wake up, which is never a pleasant thing if you have never experienced that.\nUnfortunately unlike Lucy he has had an infection that has been with him for a month, no antibiotic has cured it, not only that but the puss and fluid have not drained. So they will make an incision to let it drain before they put in the tubes the bad part is it's very painful, so the doctors tell me. Luckily Talmadge is a tough little boy, most of the time during his ear infections (9 since November) he never really cried, or woke up a lot at night, the only indication I ever has was a fever and loss of appetite. So hopefully he will not be to miserable when it's over.\nOh! How not fun! It never DOES get easier to see your kids cry because they are scared or hurt. But at least he won't remember it, and it will help him out a ton in the long (and sounds like short) run.\nPoor little guy! I can not even imagine what he must feel like. I hope it goes well and solves all the problems!\nGood luck girl! Let me know how things turn out. Wish I could be up there.\nSo nice to hear your Grandchild is having surgery on a blog spot!!\nDad told me or I still wouldn't know. So much for concerned parents/grandparents.\nAmber you poor thing could anything else happen...Knock on wood. Hey when you get a chance check my blog cause I pictured Tagged you. The rules are on the post. Good luck with all thats going on.\nAmber - I'm so sorry you have to go through this. Knock on wood, but I haven't had to see my kids go under anesthesia yet. Hang in there. I hope the tubes really help Talmadge!",
