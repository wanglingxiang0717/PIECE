Recommendation to increase Munis Contract with GSI or providing security guard services by 454,500 city.Vice Mayor.Yes. Yes, ma'am. Thank you very much. You know, I put this out there because, you know, I was somewhat disappointed in the contract because probably our analysis made a lot of assumptions. I'm not comfortable, you know, sourcing out for public safety service unless extremely necessary.Also, it was shameful that we are having to have a discussion on contracts so close to the expiration date. Long Beach have always had employ a dedicated workforce and a special security office to protect us. Civic facilities have done and continue to do an outstanding job.I'm hoping to meet. I'm hoping to meet and confer a process. We work with them and find a way to bring these jobs back to our city employees. When the contracts conclude. With that, I would like to make a motion to approve this contract.But the clause that our city manager worked to the best ability to find a solution that will restore the majority of these positions back to the city employees when this contract terminates. And that report, the city and we put it back to the city and return with a plan before the end of the year.I'm hoping I can get a second. And thank you very much.You have you have a second there. There is no public comment on this item. Councilman Pierce. I'm sorry. Country Ranga.Thank you, Mayor. I'm very. I'll be happy to second that motion. One of the things that I think that we're missing here is the fact that when you do a Prop hour study, it's not only about finding out whether we need the services at all, but whether we need to hire more staff.And I think that this approach that we're having, the way we're looking at this is is reversed. We're looking at the fact that the services that we need are to cover positions that we don't have. And we need the supplemental services provided by this agency, when, in fact, we should probably be looking at creating more positions thatour city employees can provide because those are continuing services as we go, for example, security at the library, that that would be something that's in part of our internal service that we should have as city and have city employees provide that service as opposed to a contract service.So that's, I think, the essence of of of what we're what the motion is trying to to present here is the fact that we need to have a review. Whether are we are we properly staffed in in our security services classification to provide the services that are needed on a on a continuing basis and not have torely on contracts to provide that service.Thank you. Councilmember, there's a motion and a second. Please go ahead. And Castro votes.Councilmember Pearce.In public. There's no public comment.Look.Motion carries.\nSummary:",

Item 21, please.Item 21 is a report from Economic and Property Development and Development Services recommendation to adopt specifications for the purchase and development opportunity at Broadway and the Promenade North, declare the city owned subject property as surplus and authorize city manager to execute all necessary documents with Raintree Evergreen for the sale of the purchased property in the amount oftwo 8.2 million. District to.Staff report please.Mayor, council members and other sale and Purchase Agreement Staff Report by Mike Conway, the Economic and Property Development Director.Mia Garcia. Members of the City Council. The property located at one 2701 35 East Broadway at the northwest corner of Broadway. And the promenade is a vacant lot containing 45,280 square feet, which is slightly over one acre in size.The property was categorized as future development in the long range property management plan, which properties are disposed through a request for proposals process.The city received.Four proposals submitted in response to the RFP and the review panel analyzed the four proposals from the perspective of best value for the city. The four proposals are very similar in nature 4 to 6 storey residential development over podium parking with ground floor retail or co-working space.The proposals are all very high quality, high density, architecturally appropriate, generated a good level of jobs and are within a very tight range and total development costs based on the best value to the city. The panel selected Rain Tree, Evergreen LLC Rain Tree offered the highest price for the property, which was 17% higher than the next highestproposal. Rain Tree also offered the greatest retail and flex space square footage. Rain Tree was the second highest total development cost just 5% lower than the next highest proposal. Braintree proposes a five story residential rental project over two story podium parking with 14,000 square feet of retail and flex co-working space.With all else being relatively equal, the combination of highest sale price within 5% of highest development cost and greatest amount of retail flex space persuaded the panel to select rain tree rain trees development timeline is proposed to be 90 days for due diligence, an additional nine months for entitlement and closing 30 days thereafter.Construction is anticipated to take 24 months. Staff request some flexibility in their due diligence and entitlement timeline if unforeseen events occur that delayed the proposed timeline and was stacked with that staff request that City Council adopt specifications number RFP.EP 6-003.For the purchase and development of 127 135 East Broadway declare the property surplus authorized city manager to execute all documents necessary for the sale of the property to Raintree, Evergreen LLC for $8.2 million and accept categorical exemption. S.E. 16 Dash 128 And that concludes my report.Kate, thank you. Voicemail before a voicemail goes up. So, Mr. Cano, I know that the staff reports are really detailed, which is great. When we do when we do in the future, just parcels like this, it'd be nice just to get the maps up on the screen, just for the for the public.I think we've got to show the parcel. We have to show if there's a proposed design that's I think we've got to include that. I know that the staff report has a lot more, but I think just for.Understood. Okay. Thank you.Vice-Chair Lowenthal Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I think that's a great suggestion. And also, if there could be be a short summary of what the RFP would seek in development concepts, if that's known at the time too, I think the one pager with the maps would be very helpful for everyone.Absolutely.So I wanted to thank Mr. Conaway for his presentation and his work on this parcel. It. I know from the report and our conversations that you would certainly seek a architecturally superior design for anything that comes forward here.So I look forward to that. And Mr. Mayor, I'd like to just convey that I support this item.Okay. Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales.I'll just say I want to thank Mike Conway for his work and the vice mayor for being very open to to looking at and exploring new development and especially those who expressed interest. I think it's really important as downtown is growing, that we have great development that touches on so many different components, local jobs, density in thearea, good parking solutions. And I think all of that is is comprehensive in many of these proposals. So thank you very much, Mike.Thank you.Yes, I may also add, I know as these surplus properties come before the Council for consideration, whatever use we may have allowed in the interim, whether it's use for fee or use for a dollar a year, what ends up happening is there will be a disappointment.So whatever the use was, if the use was temporary interim parking, there will be disappointment when these properties are released for development. And so I'd like us to all keep that in context that it is always better to have an interim use on city owned property than to have it lay fallow or vacant.That's usually when the mischief comes about and there's blight at times. And so I've always supported interim use of city owned properties. And even when it's not city owned, if it's privately owned, but there's no development plan, it is far better to have an active use, as we can see at the loop on ocean and pine thanto have it vacant. So just to keep that in context, we will hear individuals that will come forward and and be concerned about perhaps loss of immediate or adjacent parking to their property that they had access to for the number of years that we had this property vacant.So I want to appreciate staff for really being able to address that and respond to that. I know those are issues that will be addressed or can be addressed through the entitlement process. And we can make recommendations for where alternate parking can be found very, very near to where the projects are currently parked.Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Gonzales. No public comment on this item. Casey, no public comment on this item. Members, please go ahead and cast your votes. I'm sorry. Someone coming up for public comment on this or no? Oh, please come forward.Hello, I'm Myron. Well, I'm with the Long Beach Gray Panthers. It occurs to me that the city has an affordable housing crisis. And why should I speak about affordable housing when we're talking about a partial sale? Well, one way you can the problem with affordable housing is money.Where are you going to get the money to create the affordable housing? Well, one way you can create affordable housing is to have a portion of whatever the sale prices for city properties be put aside for affordable housing.That is, developers who want to create in their own development help pay for affordable housing within the housing within the city of Long Beach. And so what I would like the council to consider is a proposal like this, similar to one in which Los Angeles is considering, in which when development funds are are used, when developers arecoming to the city and creating and proposing to buy property that added to their cost is a whatever you want to call it, a cost for affordable housing. And that's my proposal for the council to consider.Thank you, sir. Any other public comment? Okay. CNN members, please go ahead and cast your vote.Well, she carries Andrews. I'm sorry. Motion carries.Okay. Thank you. And I believe this the parcel we just passed is the Broadway blocks. I mean, that's a you think about the amount of investment the city has made on the Broadway block. This will connect that final piece of that downtown promenade.So that's that's a pretty important parcel. So congratulations to everybody as part of that.

Agenda Item nine Council Bill 119 352 Wellington City Department Amending Ordinance 125 493 The committee recommends the bill pass.Spring BAGSHAW.Thank you very much. This is the supplemental ordinance with summary details. One moment, please. We are still back. I just want to make sure I've got the right materials here in front of me.Take your time. There's a lot of material going through, so.Thank you. I just don't want to lose all of this. Okay. Thank you. All right. So this is our $17.4 million budget transfer. So, Seattle City Light presented budget change to Art Committee for $17.4 million. This was really associated with their large capital project.And after they had gone through their project planning, they learned that there was an additional growth in our city of about 8000 more advanced meters that were added to the AMI purchase. The whole project was forecasted as being $84.1 million, which was within their budget plus last year.And then as a result, when you do the math that they needed to transfer $17.4 million in 2018, it's not a hit on our general fund. The money will be transferred from within existing resources to cover the budget changes.And we grilled them fairly hard about why did this happen. Many of us read about the failure to add sales tax in the original project. They had an explanation for why that happened. They've also put in procedures to make sure that it doesn't happen again.So with 14.7 million for the meter installation and another 2.7 for systems I.T. and licensing, that brings up the total of the 17.4 million they would like to transfer. And the committee recommends that they be that request be approved.Very good. Any comments or questions, Councilman Gonzalez?Thank you, Council President. I just wanted to thank the chair of the Finance and Neighborhoods Committee for allowing me an opportunity to be one of the individuals who was grilling the department around some of the additional allocations and appropriations that they were requesting.One of the concerns that I had expressed during committee was around what looked to be and is in fact a shifting of dollars from the city's led streetlight conversions program and also some funding that had been previously allocated to doing some right of way improvements.And my concern that the appropriation that was being suggested that we're about to take action on today would have a disproportionate impact on neighborhoods or communities who had been waiting for the LED conversion to occur in their neighborhoods.Of course, this is an important program for public safety reasons and livability concerns. I just wanted to report to my colleagues that I was able to work with the Seattle City Light Agency to get confirmation that this action that the full council is about to take will not affect the deployment of the led street light conversions andthat the contractor who is performing the LED lamp conversions is in fact fully funded within this program through the end of the year. So it I'm comfortable voting in support of this bill at full council today with the reassurance from Seattle City Light that this will not have a disproportionate impact on neighborhoods who've been waiting for thisinfrastructure to come to their neighborhoods. And with the understanding that and the representation that from that agency that all 2018 planned replacements will be completed in 2019, even with this budget transfer.Very good.

Clerk Please read item number 12.Item 12. Report from Parks, Recreation and Marine Recommendation to award a contract to buy construction for the Willow Springs Park Wetlands Restoration Project. For a total contract amount not to exceed 1 million 101,577,000. District seven.Councilmember U ranga.Yeah. Thank you, Vice Mayor. I'd like to have some public comment first before I make my comments though. They're here to support some individuals who are here to support this project. So like to hear from them first.Sure thing. Let's go ahead and hear from staff.Vice mayor, councilmembers, Parks, Recreation and Marine Development Officer Meredith Reynolds will walk us through this great project.Thank you, Mr. West. Good evening, Mayor. Member City Council. Tonight will provide a brief presentation on the Wetlands Restoration Project at Willis Springs Park. Willis Springs is a 48 acre undeveloped park bounded by Springs to the North, California to the West, Orange Avenue to the east and the municipal and Sunnyside cemeteries to the south.The project is in the direct result of the Willow Springs Master Plan adopted by the City Council in January 2013 after a substantial community engagement effort. The master plan included such natural elements as bio swales, a water treatment, wetland, public trails and sustainable planting areas.To start the planning process for these natural elements. The city applied and was awarded $50,000 from the Southern California Association of Governments for the development of a habitat creation plan. The Habitat Creation Plan was completed in August 2015 and was the basis for the design of the Willow Springs Wetland Restoration Project.The city also applied for and was awarded 924,000 Urban Greening Grant for the project in June 2014. The Urban Greening for Sustainable Communities Grant program was funded by the State of California Natural Resource Agency through Proposition 84, which provided funds to preserve, enhance, increase or establish urban forests, open space, wetlands and community spaces in the built outurban areas of California. The Wetlands Project is now ready for construction and is planned to be substantially complete by May 2017 when the grant funds expire. The Willow Springs Wetlands Restoration Project is an 11.5 acre project with the larger 48 acre Willow Springs Park.The project implements key components from the master plan, including removing non-native trees and exposed damaged piping. Planting approximately 200 native drought tolerant trees in approximately 6000 native drought tolerant plants. Installing 209,000 square feet of irrigation and mulch. Constructing approximately 43,000 square feet of ponding areas.1700 square feet of bio swales and a connection to the flood basin. Constructing an outdoor classroom seating area and installing interpretive signage. And finally, converting the existing dirt access road to 2400 foot public pedestrian trail. The site playing on the left on the slide behind you shows the overall layout of the Wetlands Project.On the right or a few of the conceptual images used as inspiration for the design. The final design that depicts the design intent of the project is accessible from the long view point parking lot. Visitors will walk west down the baseline trail to the wetlands basin below, where interpretive signage will share the story of the arches thatprovided the Long Beach first water source. The history of past railroad, water and oil uses of the property and highlight important information about the site's restored seasonal wetlands. From the beginning, the project's philosophy was focused on sustainability, both to use the natural environment of the site as well to reuse as much as possible to maximize the project'sfunds. The project design uses the existing site topography to create a unique open space unlike any other in the city system. And as a result, the construction will exhibit a light touch on the land with the uses. Over the years, there are many interesting things found on the property, including large chunks of concrete, wood and pipe whichhave been incorporated into the design of the project to reuse as much on site as possible. The total project budget is $2,089,832, which is funded by a variety of sources, including the Urban Greening Grant and one time funds set aside for the park and A14.The project cost is listed on the side behind you and includes a construction which is part of your recommended actions this evening. Staff is recommending the City Council adopt plans and specifications and award a contract to biotech construction company Inc for the Willow Springs Wetlands Project and authorize the city manager to execute on necessary documents to alsoauthorize the city manager to appropriate 924,000 and the Urban Greening Grant for sustainable communities to fund the project. And finally accept the categorical exemption. 16. Dash 194. That concludes my staff report, and I'm available to answer any questions.Thank you for that report. And as requested, we're going to take public comment before council remarks. Is there any public comment on this item? Okay. As in every other public coming in to line up, we should probably just line up now.Oh. Okay. Okay. Sir, you have 3 minutes. Please give us your name and receipt.Okay. My name is Leif Fukui. I'm a resident of sixth district. I'm also founder of Wrigley's Going Green and the Clean Team. And I also sit on the city's tree advisory committee. I just want to say thank you for all the hard work that city staff, the city manager's office and Sustainability Office, and particularly Councilmember Suranga andhis staff for keeping this project alive and keeping it going. It's advice. It's vitally important for this for our area because we're very park deprived. And so I think this is a first step to getting this park established and getting it running.My one concern is about the security going forward. As you may have known that the the train station was that was moved there was, you know, destroyed in the fire. And also, I think last month, Sasha's farm locked, 59, was vandalized.So my concern is that we have adequate security there either. And also from the neighboring properties there. There's holes in the fences. There's a lot of homeless activity going in and out of there. So my concern is that going forward, the the the the new materials that are being utilized in this park get protected and safeguarded.But having said that, this is a great project, and I really hope you support this. It's important for Long Beach and it's important for all the residents. So thank you very much.Thank you for your comments. So we'll take it back behind the rail. Councilmember, your anger.Thank you. And I do want to thank the Parks Recreation Department, the Office of Sustainability, Public Works and Department Development Services for their efforts in making this happen. I know that the Will Springs Park has gone. Site has gone through many iterations and plans and changes.And I think that this is one that is going to be one of the best workable ones that we be adequate for that park. It's a natural habitat and it will be an opportunity to activate it as a as a place where people can go and enjoy the the natural scenery and the quietness and enjoy the thethe biosphere that will be restored there in that area. In regards to the depot, it was a very sad day, obviously, when it when it went under the flames. But I'm hoping that we can be able to either through restoring it or having some kind of other building there, that will provide information for visitors to learn aboutthe history of Willow Springs, to learn about the history of Long Beach, and if not a deep oil restoration at all, but at least something that we can have there to provide visitors with with a place to to visit and learn more about the Little Springs Park area and Long Beach as a whole.We are going to be addressing the public safety issues I've spoken with with our city and city staff in regard to that raised. I raised the same questions in regard to those opportunities that people have to enter the site where there are holes in the fencing.We will be addressing that. So I'm hoping that once this project is completed that those areas of concern will be addressed. We're looking at possibly activating the site right around. August, September. And then taking it forward from there.So I want to thank everybody who has assisted with this project and of course, for the support of the community for having them come forward. And so I asked my contact. Colleagues, support the motion. Thank you.Thank you. Next, we have Councilwoman Mongo.I want to thank the.Staff and the community for the work that they put into this. I think this is a project that.We will all be very proud of and a a good use of a step forward for Parks and Rec to the community. So thank you for your work on this.Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.Yes. I, too, wanted to congratulate everybody that's worked on this, putting together the funding, the design and everything. I know that for a while we've had folks from the West Side or North Long Beach go and see our wetlands over on the east side of town.And so I think it's really fantastic that we're creating more spaces for people to walk and enjoy nature. And so congratulations.Thank you. Councilman Austin.Thank you. And I just want to add my congratulations to Councilmember Urunga, but I also want to know salute our hardworking parks and rec staff who have done a remarkable job of, you know, making Long Beach a really green and cool city.Councilmember Pearce mentioned the wetlands on the east side of town, but there's wetlands now being under development on the west side of town, along the DeForest Wetlands, along with our our Dominguez Gap and Willow Springs will just be an addition to natural greenspace that that will provide great serenity and awesome views up there.So congratulations again.Thank you. Councilman Andrew.Yes. Also, I'd like to congratulate Councilman Durango for this magnificent park that we put in. And I just also like to give kudos to our Parks and Rec director, because, in fact, it seems like any place that there's a green or no green, they finding a place to do something for our city.Because the fact that you guys have to understand that, you know, we know that Park. Park is something that we all need and our kids and our families and everyone else, especially that would next to the sixth district.And we have a tree planters up here. They're going to make sure that everything goes well. And I want to thank you guys for coming out and supporting this. Thank you again and congratulations. See you later.Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.Yes. Great job to our city staff as well as Councilmember Muranga and the community for this amazing project. I look forward to seeing more similar to this. And just again, congratulations. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember Super.Now I'll add my congratulations to the councilmember from the seventh District. And I also in particular want to mention Larry Rich, who's in the audience up there. But you can waived his Larry. Larry and I go back on this project a lot of years.I can't remember what year you brought forward, but I don't think it would have happened without Larry's efforts. So. Thank you, Larry.Thank you. Thank you. Congratulations. And I would just add that, you know, I remember following this and correct me if I'm wrong, Meredith, but is this one of the largest park expansions, you know, in recent history? Could you just elaborate just a moment for that?So will the Springs Park is a 40 acre parcel. This is about 12 acres, just under 12 acres. So some of the other comparable ones across the city include the Divorce Wetlands and Drake, Chavez, Greenbelt and some of the other green belts that are coming up here are comparable, but certainly one of the largest.Thank you and councilmember you Ranga as as we're pretty built out city these these interesting creative ways to develop and expand you know along rivers and rights of way that's how we're going to really change some of the inequities in terms of open space.So congratulations to you for bringing this forward and congratulations to Parks and Rec members.

Mayor are members of city council making stout presentation will be Amy Bullock, Director of Development Services Department.Mr. Mayor, members of the City Council, we are here today to have a first reading of the billboard ordinance based on direction that you provided to staff back in January. Specifically, we made modifications to the language to allow development agreements to be utilized in the event that copies cannot be utilized.And that we also made changes to the regulations requiring private room prior or removal of billboards that are to be demolished before a building permit can be issued for construction of a new billboard. We have made additional minor amendments to the language to reflect suggestions that have been provided to us by billboard companies related to the OutdoorAdvertising Act when they preempt the city. We've also made some clarifications on how we would measure light and glare studies and the technical specifications related to that. We have provided consistency now that previously did not exist in distances that billboards can be allowed, electronic billboards can be allowed from residential districts or institutional and park districts.And we've provided some other clean up language that you have in your red line version. The sum result of this is, I believe that we have struck a balance and have two different processes that various companies can use, depending on whether they have a lot of inventory or no inventory in the city in order to achieve thegoals of electronic billboards in specified locations, and then clearly the removal of billboards in the neighborhoods where they may not be as appropriate. So with that, I'm going to wait to answer any questions that really does conclude my staff report, and we're available to answer any technical questions you may have.Mr. Mayor, do you like a motion.As always, in order.Moved to accept the staff recommendation?I believe there's three.

Amending other provisions to implement Juneteenth as a legal holiday, conform with state law and make technical corrections and amending sections 4.20.190 and 11.1 4.277 of the Seattle Municipal Code.Thank you, Madam Clerk. I moved to pass Council Bill 120184. Is there a second.Second.Second.Thank you so much. The bill has been moved and seconded. I am going to hand it over to Councilmember Morales, who's the sponsor of the bill to address the item.Thank you. Council President. The proposed legislation, as Judy just said, would establish Juneteenth as one of 11 legal holidays for city employees. It would automatically cover non-representative employees and cover represented employees subject to their unions agreement. It would not apply to uniformed police and fire employees as those employees establish their holidays by collective bargaining.It would also establish Juneteenth as one of ten parking holidays. I grew up in Texas. So Juneteenth, the Juneteenth celebration isn't new to me and was made a state holiday in Texas in 1980. And I knew as a kid that this day was really special for our black neighbors.I know that some believe making this a holiday diminishes the uniqueness of the celebration by offering it to everyone. But I think it's important that our country acknowledges slavery. This holiday, as we as we recognize it as a city, also allows us to acknowledge the legacy of trauma for generations of black Americans and to demonstrate an understandingof the need to actively pursue an anti-racist society. So establishing Juneteenth as an official city holiday gives us an opportunity to remark on our progress toward achieving that goal and bring awareness to the work that we still have to do.Thank you for those comments. Councilmember Morales, really appreciate your leadership in this area. Are there any additional comments? An agenda item for Council Bill 120184. Seeing any additional hands raised.

So item 26, Councilman Austin, then we're going to public comment. Item 26. You're on.Okay. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to, first of all, thank Councilmember Andrews and Councilmember Supernova for signing onto this resolution to support the safe disposal of prescription drugs. This issue has been picking up momentum over the years.In 2014, President Obama announced new regulations that created a convenient legal avenues for safe, environmentally friendly disposal of unneeded prescription drugs. With the new regulations, neighborhood pharmacies and others were able to set up disposal locations. These regulations were in direct response to curb the opioid epidemic, which claims more lives in each year in America than motor vehiclecrashes. Walgreens announced a few days ago that they are adding 900 drug disposal kiosks to their stores, and CVS plans to install 750 kiosks by June of this year. The opioid epidemic has a direct connection with homelessness in our community.My office receives phone calls and emails daily about issues and many of the individuals experiencing homelessness in Long Beach who are addicted to opioids. Drug disposal programs are one way to help stem the growing opioid crisis and reduce the number of drugs in our community.On Saturday, April 28th, 2018, Lombard PD, in conjunction with Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, is hosting a take back pharmacy event from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 208 Atlantic Avenue. I'm sorry, 2801 Atlantic Avenue. And the event collects and expires unused pharmaceutical drugs.I encourage everyone to gather their medicine cabinet and expired drugs and collect them and attend this event. I'd also like to take a few people who are here today, and I know we'll hear from the Cambodian Association of America, Asian American Drug Abuse Program and the South Bay Communities Creating Change.Who approached me a few months ago to bring this item forward, and who are also leading the public awareness campaign to safely dispose of prescription drugs through increasingly increasing the availability of prescription drug drop boxes in multiple languages, community education, and promoting prescription drug takeback events.I want to thank you for being here, and I want to ask my colleagues for your unanimous support on this very important issue.Thank you. Councilmember Skinner. I just like to thank my colleague, Councilman Al Austin, for bringing this item forward. I'm honored to support it with him, and I'm very enthusiastic in that support. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Pearce. Councilmember Price.Thank you. I, too, want to thank Councilman Austin for bringing this forward. As I know you guys have heard me talk about repeatedly, prescription addiction and opioid addiction is a huge problem right now. Most of the homeless individuals in my district are addicted to some sort of a substance, mostly heroin and of course, methamphetamine.But a lot of the heroin abuse that we're seeing is coming from prescription drug use that's leading to heroin use. And so I'm very grateful that you're bringing this any awareness that we can raise in regards to people getting rid of prescription drugs that they're not no longer needing and raising awareness is is something that I welcome. So thank you.Thank you. As any public comment on this item, please come forward.You know.Now would be the time.Hi, guys. My name is Latoya marshall again. Yes, I have comments to it. Yeah, I got a thing to get rid of our expired prescription drugs. How do we get rid of. We are addicted to money. Yeah, I sit there.Yeah. Companies council meetings. Just sit there and decide what parts of the agenda y'all gonna jump from. Everything else supposed to be a line, which I disrespect the line. If I put in a car for a ten minute or, you know, the cards that come out ten persons to have a, you know.A word.Of it, I shouldn't have to wait 6 hours or 8 hours to sit there and say my little 2 minutes that you guys are supposed to grant me, or y'all sit there and ignore people where they get tired.And a 77 year old woman had to leave because of the simple fact you guys didn't even give her her 2 minutes that she requested. I go through this with you guys. Every time I come up here, I have questions for Dee Andrews.I spit out questionnaires to Alison King for an A housing authority. Everything else that you guys want to sit there and just act like it's okay to.Just jump the.Agenda, say, forget the people that did try to come here early and ask for 2 minutes from you guys. And then you have bring out this whole night where you do public speaking, where ten people, 20 people come up and make their comments.But people that sit there and sign these cards and say that, okay, yeah, we're going to give you a minute to speak. Don't do it. I'm six months pregnant. Been here for how long? I'm not being accommodating in any way, shape or form.And guess what? The only thing you could tell me is if you don't like it, go ahead and leave, and then my voice don't get hurt. Ah, my question is, don't get answered or I don't get the help that I ask for from you guys.I've been out here for over a year. I'm pregnant again. I'm still asking for questions, I'm still asking for help and I'm still not getting it. And you still sit there and ignore people, everything else but you, about greed, about money.So you talking about homeless people being addicted to heroin, opium. Y'all are addicted to money so much that's already blind, y'all, where y'all don't do nothing for the public. But you always say to the public, to the public it's a 13 years they help with pollution are to get rid of Styrofoam or whatever 13 years.Y'all need to really do something because you're embarrassing to this community, to this city, trying to act like y'all making changes when y'all don't do nothing but change your clothes and your wallet because they keep getting fatter. And I still didn't get my 2 minutes to talk about my issues that I.Have next speaker, please.Yes. Hi. Good evening, mayors.

And then thank you that you let me to have the opportunity to speak in front of you tonight about the prescription drug takeback three solution.And I would like to point out eight important points that are listed here that are one is the growing access of.Prescription drug in our community.Has created an epidemic in.The series of our.Survey. Two Driving under.The influence of prescription drug medications.Have created another layer of risk for pedestrians and law.Enforcement.Three black, Latino and multiple races ethnicity.Populations this proportionately.Affected by the.Prescription.Drug.Epidemic.

Six The number of.Visit for the overdoses has doubled for.Emergency visits in the past year.Seven opiate meds, painkillers, more most commonly abuse prescription drugs. And I'm thank you very much for your.Time and listening to me and for your support and your kind approval and recognition.Of these propositions to recognize and.Allow us to have this prescription drug.Takeback.Initiative in our.City. Thank you very much. Good night. Thank you. Good night. Next speaker police.Good evening. I'm by mayor and the Syrian government. Thank you so much for your time and your support. My name is only Priem and I'm working for Cambodian Association of America and MRSA and District nine. And I want to point out, this prescription drug crisis is impacting our homes, our school and our community.The abandonment of prescription drugs, particularly opiate medications, has led to a widespread misuse and addiction, notably among young adults. Recent survey data released from L.A. County Department of Public Health identified that Los Angeles survey. 21% of survey participants have missed prescription medications.The overall average and natural misuse of a prescription drug is 24 years old. However, for Latino, the average age is 18 years. For African-American, it's 20 years. Other key issues that relate to prescription drug crisis are related. Accident took over those drug poison and monitor medication and lead to easy access in the home.And in this proposal, unjust medication negatively impact our environment. On Saturday, April 28, 1928, the Long Beach Police Department, in conjunction with Langley Memorial Hospital, is hosting the National Take Back Pharmacy event. This event will support our local community organization and community volunteers to take back event, recollect and use an and pump pharmacy drug that can beabused by youth and harmful to waterways if not private. This post. We are asking the City Council to publicly declare and support through this resolution about promote prevention, through education, about take back medication, proper storage and proper disposal by responsible use.We thank you so much for your support. With national take back days the most properly through the proactive resolution, we anticipate to increase in community engagement with prescription drug prevention in Long Beach. Thank you so much.Thank you, Terry. Thank you. Speaker, please.Her band. My name is Silken and I am one of the co-founders of Long.Beach Environmental Alliance and also a community leader for the Cambodian Association of America. I have asked my friends here to wear green. Today I am taking an environmental stance on this topic. So here before you are some leaders that we collected during our beach cleanups, we probably find like.A couple.In one hour of our beach cleanup. So imagine if we.Cleaned up for.Hours and how much we were fine and people walk barefoot. I also brought this this bag of pills that are overdue.From the community.And right now, I'm the drop box. So I'm waiting until April two to drop this off. But people can also pool their unused.Prescription.Pills and drugs and some or some salts.To our beach cleanup.April 22nd, the Sun Alamitos Beach from 10 to 30. And so, again, I'm here with.CAA and Asian American Drug.Abuse Program. So they both.Recently surveyed 112.Residents of Long Beach. So 47%, 47.4% out of 55 surveys threw their unused, unexpired drugs into the trash.So imagine what will happen.Sorry when you start over.So when we talk about how pills work. So think about how.Fast acting.Medication is when it's.Ingest into your body. See.Excuse me.Excuse me. In the audience. If we could just keep it down, please. In the back, in the salmon shirt. Thank you. Thank you.Interesting. Thank you.So just imagine how pills.Medication work within our bodies.It's fast acting and is and absorbs in the bloodstream.So an environmental perspective. Think about how. How the water water.Bodies that we have on our planet. Farm streams, rivers, lakes, oceans.And how fast the medication would be.Released when they're put into the water. So it probably releases immediately when it touches the water. So if we have a drug Dropbox and we're drug takeback events.Imagine how much animals, plants and even.Ultimately saving our own butts.In regards to our health.Also.This will improve our soil and water quality. Soil, soil and water.Well, you've met your 30 or three minute shoemaker talking. If you want to complete your sentence.Just read it. Okay.So water and soil and water is vital for all life.We need.Those two resources to.Grow food. All right, food is life.What is life?What is life? Outstanding. Thank you for your comments. Next speaker, please. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Name is John Kendrick with the Low Mic Environmental Alliance. And I'm also with the Cambodian American Association, the Coalition for Substance Abuse.And I have here some of the souvenirs that I collect off the beach each day. Our bus stops, our parks and our alleys in honor of blue light stations. These are marijuana bottles that I'm finding every day on a daily basis.And sometimes I find I find marijuana still in children and picking them up. And sometimes they mix in these bottles. Not just marijuana, but other drugs with them. Some of these bottles I've had for over a year. But yet, though, when you get close to it, it smells just like I just picked it up today.And when the city sun does on the beach, they don't do a good job. They cut them up into sharp edges. So now they're becoming a hazard on the beach. Now, with everything else on there. So, you know, this is now becoming the new thing.So if you're going to have marijuana in Long Beach, we need to find a way to do it right where the right people get it for medical use. And those that's not using it is not affected by it.Because I've seen people on the bus sitting in the back with marijuana, mixing it with other things on the bus, public bus. And says Long Beach no longer use public mean, use school busses no more. All our schoolchildren have the right Long Beach transit and there are supposed it is in smaller children.So this is now also need to be included into the drug take back. So I ask you please revise what we're doing with. And not sit there and wait until we start having problems, then try to fix something afterwards.Thank you. Thank you. That concludes public comment. Councilman Austin, thank you. And I just wanted.To just acknowledge the the folks who who came out and spoke on this issue. I want to thank you for your patience and staying with us this evening and speaking on this very important issue. And again, I would ask my my colleagues for your support on this important resolution.Thank you.Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.I have to apologize for I thought I took my name.Off the list earlier. So I'm still talking right now. But earlier.When I stepped out, I want to apologize.For that. But I just wanted to say.Councilmember Austin, how much I appreciate this item.You guys know my mom's history, so let our office know how we can help in future events. Thank you.Thank you. Members, please cast your vote.Richardson. Motion carries.I'm an I.Thank you. So now we're going to go on to public comment. So I see ten speakers lined up here, but I'm pretty sure majority of them are gone. So I'm going to read through the list.

Cut done.Item 1010 Communication from Councilwoman Price Council Member Super or not and Council Member Wodonga. Recommendation to request the City Manager to report back regarding social impact bonds.There's a motion and a second. Councilman Price.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I know it's late in the night, but this is kind of an exciting request for a report. And I just want to talk about some of the highlights with my colleagues. So I'm bringing this item forward because more and more governments are experiencing cash flow problems and they're unable to commit the necessary fundsto pay for proposed solutions to urgent problems, problems such as homelessness or job placement or housing. The inability to find solutions leads oftentimes to stagnation in the way that we confront issues and limits our ability to try new ideas.Social impact bonds are pay for success type projects, and they represent one component of a rapidly growing field of innovative finance aimed at helping local governments fund critical social programs through a combination of government initiation, private investment, and a nonprofit implementation in the social impact bond model, the private sector works with governments and philanthropies to fund criticalprevention focused social programs that help address some of the municipalities most pressing problems. They've had a wide range of possible applications and have been used for different issues throughout the country, such as prisoner reentry programs, pre-K services, feasibility analyzes, parenting support and substance abuse treatment for families involved in the child welfare system, supportive housing for chronically homelessindividuals, and many other issues. Under these models, financial risks shift from the government payers to individuals and organizations willing to invest in scaling up a successful program to achieve greater social impacts with a willing coalition, which I believe we might have in Long Beach, the definitions and measuring success becomes critical components of making these initiatives work.I know that Kelly Colby from our health department. Oh, she's here, she's in the seat. Has done a lot of work on social impact bonds. She's actually worked with the professor at the Ah Nos, the professor at the Harvard Business, Harvard Kennedy School of Public Policy, where they have implemented social impact bonds in a number of municipalitiesin Boston and Denver. They've implemented ones for homelessness. And so I'm hoping that we can get a report from city staff on what these bonds are and how we might be able to use them in the city of Long Beach and partnering with some of our big corporations and businesses.I know it sounds a little bit abstract talking about it right now, but I want to convey to my colleagues that this is a real possibility for us to start thinking outside the box in terms of some ideas for funding these social problems that we have and helping come up with solutions.So I thank my colleagues who signed on to this item. I think it's a really great thing for us to look into.Okay, Councilmember, you bring.Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.

I look forward to that. And we appreciate the work. Thank you.But thank you. And is there any public comment on this item? Please come forward.Hello, Karen Reside, resident of the First District. And I'm here tonight in behalf of Long Beach Grape Campers. We enthusiastically support this project and are very excited about it. Every day our housing crisis gets worse and any low income and extremely low income projects that we can get going desperately needed in our community.So thank you and look forward to the completion of this project as quickly as possible.Thank you. Next speaker, please.Thank you. Shirley Bouchard. I think I believe Mr. Gonzalez, I heard the gentleman say that it would be usable to homeless persons. I'm hoping that I know of at least 20 who are already too. They're just sitting out there.No drugs and alcohol. The only problem is that they're homeless. I know of several people who are working, who are homeless, but they're working every day. I'm hoping that that word homeless people will result in visible people so that we can start saving now and letting them know of that address so that they have a visual imagein their head of possibly where their home will be. So that as this development moves forward. They have a reason to stay in Long Beach and not go to Skid Row. They don't have to be part of the PATH program when in fact we're providing for them here.They don't have to get on the bus with a sandwich and some dollars and end up in Redding, California, or Santa Ana, California, when in fact go Long Beach is saying we can provide for our homeless people here.I'm hoping that as we're hearing this, each councilperson, this is a model. Of what Long Beach can do for their homeless people who have been here, some for 1 to 20 years. With varying stories. I'm going to make it part of my daily process in the coming year to follow this with the people that I have beenfeeding on a regular basis and keeping track of and letting them know who to contact in that district regarding this this project. And I'm looking forward to the follow suit of other El UAE projects. That can benefit the homeless.They are in each district. They are in every district. And if we just site them in and make them part of the development of corporations who want to build here and who want to profit from Long Beach, letting them know and following up that they have to make part of what they're going to do applicable for notthe low income, not just the knowing, not the moderate, but no income. No income. They have none. But Long Beach has the funds. To follow this through. For the homeless. Thank you. Thank you very much.Thank you. We have an. Was that. I'm sorry. I came in with the conclusion. A public comment. Vice mayor or. Yes. Okay. Or were you just following the list? Or are we done with the comment or are we just following?Okay. But we want public comment, correct? Okay. So, Shirley, besides spoke, did our guest you speak as well, a comment.You.Weren't able to take? I'm sorry about that. Okay.

Council members say the pocket.Thank you, Madam President. Just wanted to call this one out because we've talked about it at length. And I believe that we as a city have to repair the harm that we've done, and that starts with our contracting choices.For that reason, I think it's highly inappropriate for us to approve this contract as it reflects that we do not take murder and security seriously in this city. We approved a $4 million contract earlier this year in an emergency pinch for Allied, as we needed the staff to for the new congregate shelters.Most of us thought that we needed some special security company to provide these security services. And because there was no company large enough to compete for the emergency contract we approved Allied, knowing that as contractors for RTT, another public entity paid for by tax dollars that they nearly murdered a black man at Union Station simply for forbeing black. They beat him within inches of his life and refused to make him whole in the courts. In fact, it came to our attention during committee that Allied not only continues to deflect real responsibility for their actions with this gentleman, they attempt to get a gag order to prevent the victim and his attorney from speaking publiclyabout the victim's brutal beating because of the current heightened race relations. Now, that seems a little backward to me, if you ask me. They tried to silence the victim. And that, I feel like, is something we need to be taking into consideration.And now we're considering a $25 million contract that doesn't actually require special talent or training during the $4 million contract earlier this year. We know that there was a murder on their watch after we approved that contract. Nobody was fired.Nobody was held accountable for allowing insecurity under a $4 million security contract. And it turns out that allied security scope it it doesn't actually require special training. All it requires is observing and reporting, never intervening. So it sounds like a job we should be allowing others to do, not necessarily a global security firm known for egregious harmsranging from gender discrimination, child abuse, racism. The list goes on. And so I'm a passionate no on this contract tonight. And I hope those of my colleagues who care about safety and dismantling racism will join me in a no vote.Thank you, Madam President.Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Hines.Thank you, Madam President. I know we've had conversations with safety before about how they bring before us votes that authorize funds for things in the past. And I'm frustrated that here we are again. I know that Mr. SAP took one for the team.And I you know, the last time we talked about this and I said, I understand, Mr. Sapp, that you're the messenger, but I really don't. I think it's confounding to the political process. We're supposed to vote for things before the money is spent.And this contract is starting May 7th. And I'm just I'm frustrated that we're that we're again, voting on contracts that that are in arrears. So I just want to put that out there. I hope that we can that we can have three functioning branches of government if we are supposed to authorize funds.I hope we can do that before the funds are actually spent.

I just want to thank you, Madam President, for your support on this. This change would add a land acknowledgment to our diversity council agenda to be read after the Pledge of Allegiance. Why is this important?One of the a bit of background I have been involved in something that was pretty meaningful to me and my husband, which was the Sand Creek Spiritual Healing Run Walk. For the past several years, thanks to my former agency, the Agency for Human Rights and Community Partnerships, which supported the event over many years and commemorated and ensuredthat we don't forget the Sam Creek massacre. It begins near where the Fort Lyons location was. Over the weekend, my husband and I stopped to look at a state landmark in my district on Eighth and Vallejo because we had never seen what the plaque said before.And we found the plaque recognized that the neighborhood of Lamar Lincoln Park was the site of Camp Weld or Fort Weld. The industrial part of District three was the site in September 1864, where leaders from the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes met with the U.S. Army representatives.So I last saw Commander John Shillington, Governor John Evans and Major Edward Wynkoop for peace talks. The tribe believing they had reached and complied with peace with the U.S. Army, set up camp at Sand Creek near Fort Lyon.\nSummary:",

Councilman Lopez, your motion to adopt.Mr. President, I move that council proclamation number of nine, eight, seven series of 2018 be adopted.And has been moved and seconded comments by members of Council. Councilman Lopez.Thank you, Mr. President. Living in the shadow of the Westwood Homes for most of my life. My first understanding of community was the playground, the old playground at the Denver area. Housing authorities, Westwood Homes. Three languages I learned.Well, obviously. English. English. My broken Spanish. My, my. I call it my, my, my, my total of Spanish from last word and Vietnamese. All my friends were from that those. They spoke those three languages. And it was there where you understood community and it was there where you understood not just community, but other people.Other people and where they're from, but their struggles are. It was there as a city council man where we in during the renovation of those Westwood Homes. And we we created gardens. And to see folks who would be gardening separately, usually garden together, sharing food, sharing culture, and being able to do this in peace.Being able to do this away away from war torn countries. Being able to do this with their families and in dignity in Denver. And I got to tell you, a lot of us have been either from other parts of the country or been around other parts of the country.When you say public housing. It's different when you come to Denver and say, excuse a term I just grew up with the term and say, Oh, oh yeah, those are the projects. And they're like, What? Those aren't projects.Seriously, those are the projects. Yeah, those are nice. Compared to other cities. You have to see this from a from a perspective from around the country. There is a standard of living that Denver has upheld. There's a standard of living that everybody, A.J. has worked for.And now that standard of living is ever changing and ever evolving, because I get this all the time and I know I want to. I just I just I just want to say this on the record, because a lot of people get confused when they cruise down Mariposa.Over there in the lower and the west side. Right just right down the street like 11th and Mariposa they say all. So you got rid of the projects, huh? You got rid of all those folks. That's terrible. Where do they all go?And I'm like. It's still there. What are you talking about? Yeah. Those high rises, those fancy old buildings. Uh huh. The fact. The public housing units. Are almost indistinguishable. From market rate. Reduced rate. Any other neighborhood? Any other units?Means that we're doing our job. And that is being able to provide a unit to somebody who is in need. Without the stigma. But instead with dignity. Right. And for that, I have to say, 80 years of hard work.And you're still not done yet. There's plenty more to go. And I couldn't be prouder of this team. Can be proud of this leadership, but especially of the resident councils and all those folks who I know growing up who have become not just in now, folks who just live in the community, but leaders, some of our strongestleaders have come out of these resident councils. So this leadership thing is is a real deal. And I could be I can be more proud of that. So. From one Denver native to plenty more. Keep doing a great job.I'm proud to carry this proclamation, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Cannick.Thank you, Mr. President. I had the distinct honor of speaking at the gala, one of the 17 or 19 events you're having this year to celebrate. I'm just teasing. It's good. It's good to celebrate all year long. Anyway, it was a distinct honor to be there with the mayor and him and talk a little bit about theimpact of the housing authority, I think. Councilman Lopez, thank you for bringing this forward. And I think you did an amazing job. So just to underscore for me, I think, first of all, I don't talk about housing anymore in my work.I'm trying hard to make the switch to homes. What we do is we build homes, which is places where people live. And, you know, the DHS has been building homes for a very long time, but it has been about the people.I mean, Paul mentioned the three languages. Now we've got dozens and dozens. And I think that when I think about what it means to someone who, for example, might be in the twilight of their life, they're a senior and this is probably the last home they're going to have.And that is where they are going to, you know, be hopefully with stability, with the ability to afford food because their home is is more affordable and be able to really in dignity, you know, end their lives. People with disabilities.Right. Who might not have the ability to work in the traditional way that we often think of to earn enough to pay market housing prices. So. So regardless of whether it's the immigrant family who's getting started, the family that maybe has lost a parent and really needs to get back on its feet and it's a very temporarysituation or the for household who may need to live in this housing for for their life. These homes are really, you know, about that opportunity and about that dignity. And then what I think has been amazing watching the eight year transformation is the way that DHS has moved beyond the home and the community of people there tothinking about places. So one of the things that was striking to me as I kind of started doing housing work in this city 15 years ago, is that DHS is always thinking about what does this whole neighborhood need?Right. So if there's a food gap for their residents, it's a food gap probably for their neighbors to or what does, you know, having a safe sidewalk in a safe environment feel like when you're walking around. So it's not just about the people who live in the homes.It's about that entire community and thinking about transformation in ways that really benefit the broader neighborhoods where where you own homes. And, you know, I guess the one thing I want to say to about this is that we think a lot about your multifamily housing.But one of the secrets I think of the housing authority is that across the city, in single family homes and duplexes that you would never know are residents of that. You know, these homes that we call them scattered site and I happen to live on a block and the best yard on my block and the dearest neighborI have, I won't name her because I want to respect her confidentiality, but is a resident and lives in your home and her pride in how she takes care of it and her family, her son and her grandson live with her and just the opportunity it gives her to live in a neighborhood and thrive.Right. That integrated way of living. So so it's not just these big, tall multifamily buildings, but you may have a Denver housing authority neighbor and you might not even know it nearby. So we really have to get beyond our stereotypes and think about this agency.The last thing I will say is that thinking beyond just the home, thinking beyond just the the community is then thinking about our entire city. And so in my almost what are we at seven, seven and a half years, seven and counting years I have sat at I don't know how many policy tables with the Housing Authorityas a thought partner thinking about big catalytic ideas. We saw them here for the housing fund expansion, bringing forward the bond dollars, the live program. Many of the other really when we worked on revisions to the inclusionary housing ordinance, every policy conversation you all are there is thought partners.I often think about it is Ismail, but there's a whole team. Many of you are here, Ryan and Stella and others, Chris Carr before you and many others. So so you are thinking with us as partners about the overall realm of housing.And I think that to me is like the depth of partnership. It's it's about the physical, it's about the the integration, and then it's about this big picture ideas. And so I have found that my work would not have been possible over these years without your partnership and without all that you bring.So thank you for what you've contributed and happy 80th. It's very exciting.Thank you, Councilwoman Kennedy. Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you. I want to extend my congratulations and thanks to you as well for their 80 years of existence. I had the great pleasure of working with DHEA because I had four of their larger developments in in my former district, Curtis Park, Lincoln Park, Stapleton and Craig Newton and.I had the great pleasure of of working with Kevin Markman when he was the director. So Carpio my my former colleague, Bill Radcliffe, when he was there, when I worked for Sell, Bill had a long history as well.Some of the comments I wanted to make were about the scattered sites and just the the role that VHA is playing in helping us really accelerate, addressing the need for so many people who are struggling in this city today because of the significant rise in our housing costs and the fact that our our wages have not keptpace with the cost of housing in this city. And. You all just stand in the you know, in that place where you fill that gap for so many families and the fact that we've been able to bring forward, you know, with the help of the mayor, the $150 million that will be bonded, that will really jumpstart yourSun Valley project and the Westwood West Ridge project that will bring those units online much faster than you probably otherwise would have been able to do so. And that's only half of the money you all will be administering that with other nonprofits and trying to help bring online units in in other areas of the city.And that is so important. And without you all willing to stand in that place to help us accelerate that, we'd we'd see we wouldn't see that light at the end of the tunnel for so many families that are struggling.And I just, again, want to say thank you for for that work that you have done, the partnership that you all have had with other nonprofits. I know you did a lot of work with the Denver Road Home Program and provided vouchers for homeless families.When the Denver Road Home Program was kicking off and trying to give people a place to to live. And I again, I just can't say enough thanks for the important work that you're doing in this city. And and congratulations to your entire team and your board for the great work you guys do every day.Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Madam Secretary. Raquel.Lopez. I knew Ortega.SUSSMAN Black.BROOKS Hi. Flynn here.Grier. Gilmore. Herndon. Cashman can eat, Mr. President.All right. Madam Secretary, please close voting in the results.12 days, 12 hours.Proclamation, nine, eight, seven has been adopted. Councilman Lopez, is there someone you'd like to bring up to accept the proclamation?Yes. I'd like to bring up the executive director, Ismael Guerrero. And anybody else who you would like to bring up as well. Mr. Garrett. Great. Good evening and good to be with you as you all again. Ismael Guerrero, DHS executive director.And thank you for the proclamation for the kind words from the council. It's appropriate that we started the evening talking about Denver's great sports teams, because I have to tell you that we definitely have the best housing and community development team at the Denver Housing Authority in the country.I would dare say, given all the great work that we're doing and we know that nothing great happens without teamwork. And so we have a great and deep bench at the Housing Authority, starting with our board of commissioners who have to thank all of you.City Council approved. We have a great leadership team there that really lets us run with our ideas and our creativity and providing great vision for the organization overall. Also, as I said, have a deep bench here with some of my senior leadership team.And I would say collectively just in this room, we have over 80 years of service to the housing authority already. And if you add up among the staff, you probably have a thousand years of service to the city, given the depth and the many staff members who have been with us for four decades, really.And we have great community partners throughout the city. We can do what we do without our nonprofit partners, our neighborhood partners. Councilman Lopez mentioned our resident council board. Our resident leaders are unparalleled in the country in terms of their commitment to their neighborhoods, for their residents, and to the authority overall to our areas.And thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, for mentioning my predecessors. You know, 80 years of history, you cover a lot of ground, have a lot of accomplishments and build on the success of the past. Sal Carpio, my predecessor, was fantastic, really did a lot for the organization and for the city overall.And Kevin Markman before him is still active on the Housing Advisory Committee. I'm still committed to serving the city of Denver. Even now, when we think about celebrating 80 years, we're really looking forward as much as we're looking backwards at our accomplishments.And I just wanted to share with you, some of you have already mentioned just briefly. We're really moving beyond housing in terms of the work that we're doing, understanding that great neighborhoods and improving the quality of life of residents is more than just offering them a great unit to live in.You heard earlier in the proclamation some of our new social ventures that we're launching, including the Youth Employment Academy, our Osage Cafe, friends of the H.A., the Connect Home, Denver, which is bridging that digital divide. And our metropolitan solar farm out east of DIA is powering hundreds of public housing and affordable housing units around the city.So those are things that we're doing now looking beyond housing to really how do we change lives and impact the neighborhoods that we're in. We're also really excited now, looking forward to be a partner, a stronger partner with the city.Now that the five year housing plan has been completed and the goals and the work ahead of us has been made clear. I'm very proud that the Housing Authority staff is really stepping up to the challenge and and being part of the solution to the city's housing challenges.You heard earlier the live Denver program that was approved earlier this summer, the bond initiative that you all approved just a couple of weeks ago, which we're excited to be launching over 2000 units we expect to be delivering between in the next 3 to 5 years there.And soon you'll be hearing more about the West Denver Renaissance Collaborative and the work we're doing in to stabilize neighborhoods in southwest Denver. So those are all exciting work that we have looking ahead in the immediate future, but intend to continue to be a strong partner with the city over the next eight years.And finally, as Councilwoman Kenney mentioned, this has been a year long celebration for us. There's a lot of people to recognize, a lot of accomplishments we want to acknowledge and celebrate and our partners. And we are going to have a capstone event in December, our 80th anniversary gala.We're looking forward to not just bringing coming together with our partners who've helped us build the neighborhoods and the housing and the programs that we offer. But also as a capstone event, it'll be a fundraiser for our residents services that we offer throughout the city to youth.To adults.To seniors and disabled. So we're hoping to raise a good amount of money at the end of the year to have some funds going forward to improve and expand our resident programs.

    "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThank you. Item 18 is a report from financial management with a recommendation to adopt a resolution authorizing the award of a contract to West Coast Arborists for as needed tree trimming services in a not to exceed 2,000,680 $68,750 for a period of two years.Okay. Thank you. Mr. City Manager didn't make a report on this.Yes, Mr. Mayor, Councilmember Chase McDonnell is going to give us a quick report on this. Mr. Mayor, city council members, the staff is requesting that council consider a request to withdraw the first portion of this item to allow time for additional analysis based on new information that was received by staff.We would request approval of the second element in the amendment to the contract in order to in order for time sensitive work to be completed by the user departments. Staff anticipates being able to return with an updated request to council following the additional analysis.That concludes my report. Thank you.Can I get a motion back? Okay. There's been a motion and a second. Councilwoman Gonzales.I have a couple of questions that I just wanted to go over. Will this update include.Because I don't know if there's.A certain amount that we have to go out to RFP and why there was no bid in the first place. Can you answer that?Councilwoman, this contract was to be piggybacked off of the City of Tustin contract. So in a piggyback situation, the city relies on the competitive process of another municipal agency, and we step into the shoes of that competitive process.So Tustin had completed an RFP that we were going to be use as the basis for our pricing. West Coast Arborist was willing to acknowledge that pricing and share that pricing with the city of Long Beach.So why did we choose Tustin and what are the what are we paying per tree at this at this point?I don't know the answer to the second part of your question. The reason we chose Tustin at the time was that was a valid contract that had the longest length of time available. I'm still on it.Okay. So will the update include all that information or what will we get back when we have that?Sorry. The intention was to analyze the new information that was provided that we received last night and come back to council with a new recommendation.Okay. So it's just a new recommendation on a on a new service or a new contract or I'm sorry, or is it a recommendation to come back and go out to RFP again?We were going to analyze what was provided and then return to council with a recommendation. It could be to do the same piggyback. It could be to go to a new RFP or some other combination. We have not made that determination yet.Okay. Thank you.Thank you. I also have some questions about the you said the second part of the RFP. Currently, as it stands, you want to go ahead and proceed. That became sensitive stuff.Correct? Yes, sir.What is that and what's the cost?The second portion of the item reads Amend purchase order with West Coast price by 410,004 Mt. not to exceed 505. Some of that work includes time sensitive work by Parks Rec and Marine that for trees that will be subject to nesting requirements.And that work has to start on or about December 15th and conclude by January 15th.Okay.So there was a time sensitive issue from beginning when this went out to to bid, if you will, with the city as they went in to piggyback. We are correct.Councilmember, we did not bid this item. So again, when we relied on touchstones, we were attempting that.What I meant is that because of the time sensitivity of the issue, you went with Tustin as a piggyback contract.That was one of the considerations. Yes, sir. Okay.Well, you know, when I read all the other contracts out and I read where there's a bid put in place, or so aggregating goes through to the press telegram or some other advertising agency. And I think this does not happen here.I would I would not be supportive of this. I think we should put it out to bid.Okay. Thank you. And either.If that's if that's in the in the face of emotion, make that.Motion second.Okay. There's been a there's been a motion and he's saying now there is already a motion on the floor right now to to a to approve the recommendation as amended by staff. Sir, I'm actually running the meeting, so just relax.Thank you very much. So just say to the pro, the process is, is there was a motion on the floor that I believe was made about Councilwoman Pryce to accept the the the the motion as amended. Then now what we have just to make clear is Mr..Your angle you would you want to get substitute motion. Okay, so there's a substitute motion that is on the floor. Someone seconded today didn't hear who it was, but Councilwoman Gonzalez and that would be to go through an RFP process for the motion, is that correct?Before we go any further, and I do have some speakers, I'd like the city attorneys to comment on this just to make sure that we're this is something that is optional for the council here at this point. Go ahead.Thank you, Mayor. Yes. The the way I understand the substitute motion, I believe that Mr. Rangel said that they would approve the time sensitive nature on the additional money and then require the not approve the proposed piggyback contract, but to direct staff to go out to RFP with that portion of the agreement.If I understand that correctly. And the answer to your question, Mayor, is is is that allowed by the staff? Yes, I think the council has the authority to either approve or disapprove this contract and give further direction to staff at this time.Okay. And Mr. and Mr. West, I guess my question was more a question about I have no idea where the process on this is at at this point. So did you want to comment on that?Mr. WEST Yes, Mayor. Councilmembers One of the reasons we'll be doing this is because we are getting a better price. We've been directed by the council. Previous Council, of course, this might be a policy we might want to revisit is to go ahead and utilize bids, combine our resources with other entities to get better bids, to getcheaper prices for us that are out in the marketplace. That would include piggybacking, that would include working with the school district for stationary, for things like that. So this is something that we've been asked to do to get better pricing for the city of Long Beach.I do want to highlight that we do have some necessary work in the Tidelands area that may not be able to get done. If we have to go back to rebid this because of what Jason talked about, given the nature of the birds and trees and things like that.My question my question is this. So my interest is there's a motion, the subject motion to just essentially go up for RFP. Is it possible that by just going out to RFP that we would get a we would not get a bid as low as the one we could possibly get by going back out and doing thisadditional information and coming back, or is that not a possibility? Very possible. So I would just just mention and caution to the council, I think what staff is asking for is to come back with information. What you're going to bring back to council would be, I'm assuming could could be we want to go back to our RFPor it could be we want to go forward with our proposal or it could be a variety of options. Is that right?Yes, we could come back immediately. Honestly, we were fully prepared to go forward tonight to award the contract. However, we did get a protest last night and we wanted to do the protesting vendor, an opportunity to review his documents and all that.So we're just trying to be as transparent as possible and analyze this. We've worked with the city attorney. We certainly could have come forward and gone forward this, but we just didn't want to give an alternate vendor an opportunity to review his documents.And given what we received yesterday and I'm not saying that after review, that would change our opinion or alter it in any way. But we can come back very, very quickly with the information you're asking for.Okay. And so I just want to make that the council aware of that fact. So, you know, it's your call whether you want to go to an RFP or not, but just know that that's a possible consequence if you just don't wait for the information to come back.Councilwoman Price.It's my understanding that the first part of this item was withdrawn as the first order of business before we started talking about this. So the first item isn't even something that staff is asking for us to act on tonight.In fact, they withdrew it. The second part of it, it's my understanding that the second part is time is of a time sensitive nature because it's paying invoices for work that has already occurred during an interim purchase order.Is that correct?Yes. Jason, any other information for that? Correct. Councilmember City Manager There was there are some invoices that were incurred that we were looking to pay through this money. Additionally, Parks Rec and Marine, as I mentioned, has specific work scheduled that would be required notice scene as well as scheduling within the next 30 to 45 days.That must be completed due to the nesting issue.That's right. So if we don't do this work before the nesting season starts, then we can't do this work for some time until the nesting season is over because we don't want to harm the birds. Is that correct?Yes, ma'am, correct.Okay. So just to be clear, when when you took the first part of it off the table, the only remaining part for this agenda item was whether or not we pay the invoices that we've already incurred.The pay the invoices that we have incurred, as well as this additional work for Parks Rec and Marine, to be clear. Okay.Thank you. And I think Councilman Price, you're correct, but I think Mr. City attorney, the substitute, the maker of the subs who can still make that substitute regardless of it, because it's germane to the item, is that correct?Correct. And I understand the substitute motion includes that second portion and adds the direction to city council to go out to RFP with the first part that was withdrawn, not review the situation and come back with maybe a recommendation to piggyback or go to an RFP as I think staff originally described.Okay. So the substitute motion is to go out to an RFP on the first part and then go ahead and pay the bills on the second part.See no other council comment at this time on public. Oh, I'm sorry. You're right, Councilmember Austin.Just one quick question. How long would the RFP process take?Councilmember Probably we would estimate the RFP process.Between six weeks to. I mean, it could be it could be up to two.And a half months. Well, an RFP is a complex process sometimes.Understanding the complexity of the process. Would it be possible to expedite it?We can certainly work to make that timeline as short as possible.Thank you.Okay. Thank you. We're going to take public comment at this time. So if you remember the public wants to speak, please come forward and identify yourself. 3 minutes.Yes. My name is Gus Franklin, and I am the president of United Pacific Services. First of all, I was very surprised when I when I found out about this, the contract being piggyback on to the city of Tustin.And test them way out there in Orange County. The West Coast Company has four other cities that we bet against them that were just right here locally in the L.A. area and their average unit price on those contracts.Let's take La mirada, which is right next to the Long Beach.Was $44 per.Tree.On trimming the cost at the city of Tustin.The average cost is.$64 per trailer. West Coast is currently charging the city on their old contract $55 a tree for great trimming. It was Coles wanted to give the city a piggyback city, the one to take the city and one to bellow their charge to the city.$44 a tree for good trimming. Ah, the city of commerce. They're charging them $44 a tree trimming. We better get some. A couple of weeks ago. We bet against him in the city of Highland.They beat $44 to tree. We bet 43. 75 a tree. And the contract was.Awarded to us. We beat them by $0.25. We've been trimming the trees for the city of Long Beach since.2001 for 13 years.And during the past 13 years, they let out the contract four times for three years, three years of each. And we were the low bidder. West Coast, bit higher than.Us.Last year. Our contract was extended for one year now. We were the company that.Did all the trees in Queensway Bay.And we trimmed all the palms on the Thailand. I came down here today to to request and.Ask the city to renew.Our contract expired in June of 2014. That was from the one year extension. Can the city renew our existing contract.For until a first, maybe 90 to 6 months until you let out a.New RFP? Remember, we've been trimming your trees in the Queens way.In the Tidelands and your parks for the past 13 years. And. I think myself that West Coast does this piggybacking on a lot of different contracts. We bet against them.They piggyback from one city?We were betting against them in a contract to San.Diego.And then they piggyback from from.The Sierras.Made it. At very high unit prices.Okay.Thank you, sir.I see my time's up.Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please.Hello. My name is Jack Boring. I'm the vice president, general manager with United Pacific Services. And it was interesting.Your comment you made about the cheaper prices for trimming.That these trees that are that had to be done on a time sensitive timeline because we've been trimming those trees for the last 13 years at $25 apiece. And West Coast is priced under the proposed piggyback is $45 apiece for the same trees, 80% price increase.And the same. And Queensway Bay that we've been doing for 13 years has a budget for $75,000. For the last four years, we've been trimming all the trees in Queensway Bay for.75,000 for.Four years. The West Coast, the proposed West Coast Prize, would double the budget cost for the Queensway Bay Area to 150,000 for the same trees that we've been doing for 13 years. So I don't understand what your cheaper price argument on that one.But anyway, that's all I have to say. Thanks.Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.Honorable Members of City Council. My name is Angel James Otello, director for True Milan Company. We've been your contractor for the Parks and Rec for the last 3 to 4 years and we were also surprised when we read the agenda report trying to piggyback this contract.If you look at your staff report, you'll see that the rates for city testing are not included. I actually got a contract when the see test in city clerk and they gave me the prices that I proposed under this piggyback contract.If my company had an opportunity to bid this contract, we would instead of 64 or $50, whatever they're proposing, we would charge you $45, $47. And this is what you get when you go out to RFP. You get companies to compete for your business.There's at least 4 to 5 different companies that could do this work. We are also a contractor for City of Riverside who is comparable in size to the city of Long Beach instead of City of Tustin, ten square miles compared to 50 square miles.City of Tustin at 16,000 trees. Long Beach has more than 200,000 trees. So we were one of the contractors here, along with UPS and West Coast, was the contractor for the city, and that contract expired in June. What the second portion of this contract is asking is to take TLC out.Of the out of the.Program, take ups out of the program, and give all of that to West Coast arborist until the second portion, I believe, is in the best interests of the city to extend the current contract with TLC for the parks up W for the marina and the bay and West Coast are best for the city.Until an RFP process comes out, even if if we are offering the city of Long Beach four times out of the tree, that's a 25% decrease of the $2.6 million a year contract that West Coast is proposing. Since 80% of this money is going to come from the general fund, that's half a million dollars a year youcan save. This contract is asking for a four year contract over $10.6 million contract. That would be maybe the largest contract in the city of Califor in the state of California. And I believe that the city of Long Beach will get the best possible rate if it puts that contract out to RFP.If you look around to your neighboring cities area, Signal Hill went out to RFP and they're paying $39. The Tree City of Bellflower and Lakewood both went out to RFP and they're paying 4490 a tree. We are a contractor here in the city of Long Beach.We are a certified minority owned business enterprise. And this piggyback option is eliminating minority firms from actually giving you guys a bid. I respectfully ask council to give us an opportunity to put this out, to bid. Let the private sector compete for your business.Thank you.Could we have another speaker? Okay, last speaker.Go ahead. Okay. Think. Think. Thank you. I'm Patrick Mahoney.From West.Coast Arborist. And I just want to.We've been working here in the city of Long Beach for the last 30 years. I think all of us have different contracts, but we're welcome the opportunity if you want to go back out for bid. There's all these different prices.Long Beach has a very mature, overly mature population of trees that really 44, 50, 39. It's hard to really compare the different prices. But we're happy to go compete on an RFP basis. They're talking about extending our current contract that we currently have, and we're happy to do that.And I'm here to answer any questions if you want, but thank you for the business you've given us.Thank you. With that and to go back to the council. Councilwoman Price.I'd like to ask city staff at this point if we were to not approve the second part of this item, the item that's before us in terms of the work that's already scheduled and the invoices that we've incurred, would that delay any existing projects or work in the city?And specifically any projects that were on a tight timeline on or anything like that.Thank you. Councilman, we. We would need some money for emergency removal of limbs that are down from storms. About 50,000 of that. About 240,000 for the palm trees and the tidelands area, because, as you know, the front will have a tendency to fall.So they would trim those palm trees. So again, needs to be done before January 15. We have a tight timeline for the nesting period, September 15 to January 15. If we don't get it done by January 15, we can't do it until next September 15.So that leaves the palm trees untrained, and it's an annual trimming process for the palm trees.Now, maybe I can ask for some clarification from the maker of the substitute motion councilman or Ranga. Were you thinking that we would not pay the outstanding for the outstanding projects that we've already contracted for and go out to RFP on the work that hasn't been done?Or were you thinking in terms of the first part of who we're going to enter into a contract with?Well, what I'm dealing with, my concern is the transparency of going out to a contract. It's the bidding process that is merited in such. Contract to get out there and we do it. I understand there's been a commitment made.I understand the city charter allows for us to do this, but I'm concerned that there wasn't enough transparency in putting out the bid and maybe the city staff to give us a clarification as to how this happens. But from what I can understand or see here is that under the piggybacking section 18 or two in the citycharter, there's no information, there's no notice that this is even going to take place. It just sort of it's sort of done. For lack of a better word, better terms. And back in the back, in the back door, you know, in the kitchen sink.But I would I would like to have is an opportunity to have other agencies be able to bid for this. And any time that there is going to be a consideration about invoking City Charter Section 18 or two that we know about it.Nobody knew about it. It sort of surprised everybody and surprising me that we're dealing with this. It surprised the other vendors who are out there who didn't know who got wind of this sort of last minute. And it comes up to us at the last minute.So I think that in all fairness, for everybody to be equal on level ground, in terms to be competitive, to go ahead and do that, and we have commitments right now that we need to meet, let's meet them.But I think what we need to do is make sure that when we are awarded the more two or three year contract, that it's that it goes out to bid.And I and thank you for that clarification, and I don't disagree with you on any of that. My concern is for any projects that we've already committed to paying for or projects that they're waiting to be paid on that have been scheduled because those those palm trees, you know, when when they don't get trimmed, they're incredibly dangerous. We had one fall on a, you know, neighbors car recently in our community. And we need to yeah. So we need to make sure that that that trimming takes place. But I agree with you on the inclusiveness of the bid process and the transparency.I just want to make sure that your motion, you know, basically supports us moving forward and paying the bills for the expenses we've already incurred and paying the cost of anything that is in the process of being done and then making sure that we go through a transparent process, as you've indicated, in terms of who we're goingto award the contract to, is that okay with you? Are we on the same page on the substitute? Okay. Thank you.Councilmember Richardson.So contracts are are protested all the time. And people come to the council, they protested the I think it was the library. This stuff happens and rarely am I ever compelled by someone who lost a bid because city staff typically has a methodology for why that subcontractor was selected.Tonight, there was a compelling argument that that process hasn't gone through, and that's the process that that is the process that we should all take pride in. And we should be able to say we do have a public process that does value minority owned businesses, women owned businesses, local businesses.And when we when we circumvent that process, we expose ourselves to. To a discussion that I really don't want to be a part of. So. So that said, I mean, I'm going to support I'm going to support the substitute motion and I really want a review.I think we should have a discussion at some point about this process. I've never heard of this piggybacking until tonight.Thank you. Next, we have Councilwoman Price.In terms of the substitute motion. And again, just to clarify it. Is the maker of that motion. Okay. With staff coming back to us next week on that part, one option and letting us know exactly what happened, how they came up with that recommendation and what the RFP timeline, if that's what we chose to do, would beto give them some time to come back to us on that first.They could do that. What we're looking for is a clarification and more transparency in regards to the process. It's all about the process.That's good. That's not going directly to RFP, though. That's different than the first time. So what I'm hearing then from what the substitute now is, is to have staff come back at the next council meeting and explain not.So you didn't accept that. Okay. So I want to make sure quickly different motions here and I want to just be very clear about what they are.Council to pay our bills and go up to our people per.Council. Council Councilmember, your rank is motion, as I had understood it prior to the question was to directly go to RFP on the first part and then to to pit to pay for the second piece. The original motion, which was I believe made by Councilman Price, is to also pay the bills section.But then on the first part, to give staff some additional time to come back and kind of walk the council through how they got to that process. And I believe to meet with the or have a discussion, at least with those that are have an issue with with the contract being awarded this way.Is that correct? Mr. West.Yes, we did. And again, we'd be comfortable with the substitute that gets the work done on the Tidelands. And again, I am hearing perhaps we do need a discussion with the new Council regarding the piggybacking policy as well.So that's separate. So there's two, there's two motions. So. Councilwoman Gonzales.I think my questions were answered about the piggyback because I want to get more familiar with it as well. So that's about it.Okay. Mongo. And then we're going to vote.So I'm going to be supporting the original motion, which I don't know if I was the second on it or not. Mostly because I want to follow through with the process as it was started so I can find out what happened before I make a vote to go out to bid.I want to have a full understanding because I don't think that we have all the information yet. And so I'd like to say that I'll be okay.So now we have the substitute motion, which is the Durango motion. Please cast your votes. Well.Motion fails. Four votes. Four votes? No.Now we have the original motion, which is to come back, have council come to have to come back. And the second part will be paid. The first part would come at the council members. Please cast your vote.Let me capture the no's on the previous vote. Please cast your vote.Please cast your votes. This is the original motion.Motion carries seven votes, one vote no.Okay. Can I also ask Mr. West, there's been enough discussion about this provision that I think it deserves a conversation either at the council or in the member for matters. I think clearly the council wants to talk about the process as far as moving forward itself.Mayor Councilman, I totally agree. And if we're going to continue to use that policy, I want to make sure it is supported by the Council.I also think it's important that this issue come back ASAP. So at the next council meeting, if we can please have this issue back on the council agenda. Sir. Okay. Next item.Item. Item 19 is a report from the Health and Human Services Department with the recommendation to adopt a resolution declaring a shelter crisis for the operation of a winter shelter from December 1st, 2014 and March 15, 2015.

Councilman, who will you please put council bill 324 on the floor?I will do. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll move the council. Bill 324 be order published as amended. Oh, just.I just ordered published.I'm sorry. Order published.Move the council bill 324 be order published.That's right. Sorry. It has been moved. No problem. It has been moved in second. Councilwoman Black, will you go ahead and offer your amendment, which will notify business owners when the change in hours would take place in the event this bill passes?Thank you, Mr. President. I move that council bill 324. Mr. Nutter, I moved the Council Bill 324 be amended in the following particulars on page one, line 28 at the following language. Section three. This ordinance shall be effective Monday, May 1st, 2017.It has been moved in. Second, it comments by members of Council. Councilman Black.According to the city charter, a newly adopted city ordinance is effective upon final publication unless a definite effective date is provided in the ordinance. Sometimes there is public confusion about when final publication of a bill actually occurs. The purpose of the amendment is to clearly communicate to the public and to the marijuana industry the first date uponwhich any retail marijuana store or medical marijuana center may remain open until 10 p.m. will be Monday, May 1st.Okay. Madam Secretary, roll call.Black eye. Clark Espinosa I. Gilmore Herndon Cashman can eat. Lopez All right. New Ortega. My assessment. Mr. President.I have already announced results.12 eyes.12 eyes, Constable. 324 has been amended now. Councilman Ortega. Would you like to speak on your proposal that you want to offer in the next week?Yes, I would. And I am introducing it so that people can have the opportunity to speak to it tonight. Although it will formally be brought forward until next Monday. So basically what I am working on is in our city attorney will have some language to me this week that I will get out to all of you.So applications would automatically be approved to the new time of 10:00, except those that are awaiting a license, that have made an application to the city and awaiting demonstration, or to show them to demonstrate that they are in compliance.And in addition to that, those that are going through the show cause process, unless and until the application is granted in accordance with all applicable laws or the disciplinary action has been resolved. So it would be, again, the pending licenses and those that are going through the show cause process that would not be allowed to automatically extendtheir hours until they can demonstrate that they're in full compliance. So I will be bringing that forward on Monday night. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you. Councilman Ortega and Councilman Hernan understand that you want to have a conversation about one that you're going to bring next week.Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. And this should serve as no surprise to those because of the emails and phone calls that I've been getting. But the conversation has been solely about whether or not to increase marijuana hours. And as we started to look at the data about the current operating window that we have now, a majority ofthe dispensaries in the industry aren't even utilizing the full window of an 8 a.m. to a 7 p.m.. So I was considering a proposal to shift the hours so that would be more optimal and efficient where we'll increase the hours on the back end, but we'll also shift the hours on the front end.So that is a conversation that I've had with people within the industry as well as council colleagues, and I will consider bringing that forward in an amendment next week. It seemed more reasonable to discuss all the amendments at once versus one amendment today versus another amendment next Monday.So we'll have the opportunity to discuss multiple amendments next Monday. Thank you, Mr. President.All right. Thank you, Councilman Hernan and Councilwoman Ortega. The one hour courtesy public hearing for Councilman 324 is now open. May we have the staff report? Councilwoman Black.Thank you, Mr. President. This is a bill that will extend store hours to 10 p.m.. Currently, marijuana stores and medical centers close at 7 p.m., which was an arbitrary time and a holdover from old medical rules. State law allows them to be opened till midnight.The original bill proposed midnight, but after having three committee meetings since January three, public comment period. We'll have another hearing tonight. We heard from I.N.S. that recommended 10 p.m. the committee a compromise to 10 p.m.. So I was really pleased with all of the work that we did and to come up with that compromise.Many of our surrounding jurisdictions have later hours and they have not seen issues related to crime or neighborhood issues. We've heard from Edgewater and Aurora. Again, I'll say that this is a practical matter. We are not adding new locations.The stores are already open. This is about convenience. It might mean increased tax revenue for Denver. Later hours do not contribute to the black market or youth usage. Law abiding citizens of legal age patronize these stores. They are not kids.They are not drug dealers. In fact, by having our legal stores open, we are actually undercutting the black market, which is a good thing and which is one of the reasons many people voted to legalize marijuana. Additionally, open storefronts are a deterrent to crime.Businesses are broken into when businesses are closed, not when they're open. And lastly, a few months ago, the Denver Post editorial board recommended that the city council extend store hours. So I look forward to hearing the public comments.And please also feel free to comment on both Councilman Herndon and Councilwoman Ortega's proposed amendments. Thank you.All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Black. We have ten people signed up tonight. To all of our surprise. And so I'm going to call the first five speakers up. I think you can come up to the first bitch and then we'll call the next five up.So I will call up John, Eduardo, etc. and use sort of. Hiney, Leslie. Rudolfo Gonzalez. Nick Lovullo. And Tiffany Goldman. Mr. of your first.First, I'd like to thank the council for letting me speak to you about this important issue. I'm here representing said we are saying we support the extension of the hours. We understand that every hour that there's a legal dispensary open is taking time away from the black market and dealers that are actually selling to underage people.We want them to disappear and we want it to be a perfectly legal, legal, regulated industry. And therefore, we support this. Also, one of the very important things to us, two other points is one of them is businesses should decide when they open and they closed, except obviously the 10:00 closing hours for everybody.So we would like to the 2 hours that they're talking about cutting it down the morning, it would allow access for people to work in the afternoons to go early in the morning. So we're opposed to any reduction on the hours from.We want it to be from 8 to 10 because that way people that work in the afternoon can go there in the morning and get their marijuana. And same thing to 10:00. People who work during the days can go and get there.And we believe it's very important for people to have that access. And we very much do believe that dispensaries eliminate the black market. And that's why we're in support of the hours.Thank you, Mr. Kenny. Lesley.Good evening, council members. My name is Hanni Lasley and I'm one of the co-founders and the executive director of Smart, Colorado. As you all know, Smart Colorado formed after the passage of Amendment 64 in 2013 when we legalized and commercialized recreational marijuana for individuals over the age of 21, Smart has thousands of supporters across the state, includinghundreds of citizens in Denver. We are a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that voted both for and against legalization. We formed when Public Health and Safety around Colorado, kids ranked last among our state policymakers. We've also worked closely with Denver City Council and Denver citizen groups.When Denver decided to opt in for commercialization. Our sole purpose is to protect kids from the unintended consequences of marijuana. Smart does not take any state or local tax revenues, and we receive donations from everyday citizens as well as private foundations.We'd first like to thank you for your willingness to examine the ordinance, for taking it down from midnight until 10:00. We do appreciate that very much, because our big concern about this ordinance is twofold. Number one, that it's being considered at the same time as the initiated ordinance 300.Rules and regulations are being rolled out. That is a very large policy shift for this city. And to add another one on top of it does not really allow us to properly vet the impact to our kids. So we would just like to thank you for your consideration around that.And also just the concern that we all know that additional accessibility in alcohol and tobacco do lend to greater youth use. And while we don't have the data yet around marijuana, this is a concern as we're the first to do it.And Denver is really the epicenter. So we'd like you to we first like to thank you again for your consideration on 10:00, but we would ask for your consideration to delay the implementation of this ordinance after we've had a chance to vet the impact of the initiated ordinance 300.And with that, I thank you.Thank you, Miss Leslie. Rodolfo Gonzalez. Okay. Nick Lovullo. You have 3 minutes.Hello, Nicholas, from five points. Councilman Brooks Mayor. Representative, I will say that I'm pretty disappointed after all of these meetings since January and all the input from the city and the best to come out with a three hour extension.I don't know if you didn't look at the data that was presented. We've got law enforcement officers counting on one hand the number of marijuana crimes that have occurred in the last five years. I don't understand the source of that.I don't I'm not even sure how you would arrive at the conclusion that it's a prudent decision to shut off all of the legal avenues for marijuana purchases when the black market is at its most active after 10:00 at night when people are out.I think it's frankly reckless for you to not increase the extended, extended dispensary hours till midnight when we are going to have marijuana clubs and increased people, increased number of people and number of businesses that are offering places to consume.I don't understand how you think it's prudent. I don't think you can even escape that argument. So I would say over the last three months, it was a pretty lousy rally as far as these council committees were going.I would like to submit an amendment. Let me just skip to the end because I'm. I would like to submit an amendment that the dispensaries set their own hours within the timeframe already established by the state. And you guys don't have a say in it, and the state can do whatever it wants.And, you know, this is a battle we don't have to fight every single time. And every single time this comes up, there's always posturing. You know, we always you know, we want to shift the dispensary hours. All we want to, you know, eliminate the dispensaries that just complicate things.It's absurd, you know? And then, you know, the marijuana at the marijuana special committee, we got to hear from Smart Give Smart Colorado a platform at the first of all, they're not even the topic wasn't even germane. Second of all, the prisoner no offense.I mean, I don't know when she's sitting up here and waits in line like him, like me and voices her opinion. But she's not even one of your constituents. She's even live in Denver. I don't even know why that why they were given a platform.All these quotes in The Denver Post that you guys, you know. Well, prohibition doesn't work, but 12 midnight is a nonstarter. So prohibiting sales at 10:00 will work somehow. I'm not sure how that works. Dispensaries are bad neighbors.My residents say, well, I mean, who's poppin who's popping caps off in northeast Denver? Is it the dispensaries? The drive by shooting and the marijuana deal gone bad and sunny side that that that drive by shooting happened at 1145.Maybe if the dispensary was open at midnight, the guy wouldn't have shot up a house. He would have gone shot as a bartender. That'd be something. I mean, we'll never know. It's just at this point, after all of this deliberation, I'm running out of time.But midnight to no brainer. It's not a prudent decision to shut off the legal avenues for emergencies.I was just going to say you ran out of time. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Mr. Lovato. All right. Tiffany Goldman.Hello. My name is Tiffany Goldman. I'm in Denver. Accident. I'm here today on behalf of the health center. All of our facilities are located here in Denver. And I'm proud not only to work and live in this beautiful city.And thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak today. I'm here today to support later hours of operation. A business should have the right of decision making for each and every aspect related to business processes. I am in support of hours of operation from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m..I understand that Denver decided to reduce these hours originally to see where the cannabis rollout would go. I do believe we can all agree it has been hugely successful. I believe we are the pioneers in this industry. I'm not completely sure why.Denver, one of the fastest growing cities in the United States, would not ground a business the rate of operating their business hours in conjunction with state law. As we know, the world is watching. Colorado cannabis should be treated like other businesses.Not only do I believe in business rights, but the increase in job opportunities would be astronomical for this city. It's my understanding that there is a proposed amendment to this bill change the hours from ten to term. This is a little concerning to me since many of my single parent family employees would lose their ability to pickup their children from school after their first shift. Thank you.Thank you, Miss Goldman. All right, the next. Aubrey Lavoisier. Margie Valdez, Kay Gallagher. Please say your full name when you're up here. Kristy Kelly. And Rudolfo Gonzalez again.It's a different person.Oh, it's a different Rudolfo. Okay, well, maybe Rodolfo Gonzales number two can come up. All right. Aubrey. Yes.Thank you, Councilwoman Brooks. My name is Doctor Aubrey Labrador. I am a member of the Order Advisory Group from Denver Health and Environment or Environmental Health, and also the Social Consumption Advisory Committee of Excise and License. I'm here to support the extended marijuana dispensary hours, and I am opposed to amendments when the state of Colorado allowed extensionof marijuana dispensary hours. Denver did not follow suit. I'm going to propose to you that it was maybe a boogeyman in a closet kind of mentality, a fear based regulation about some boogeyman named crime. But marijuana related crime in Denver has decreased every year since 2012.Marijuana. And that's courtesy of Denver. Gov dawg. Marijuana adult use in Colorado is unchanged, but higher than the national average. That's courtesy of Colorado Department of Health. Marijuana adolescent use is unchanged but is lower than in 2013, and in fact, it is 21% in Colorado versus 22% of adolescents nationally.It's and it's actually less than adolescent alcohol use, which in Colorado is 30%, according to Colorado Department of Public Health. So I'm going to say marijuana is not the boogeyman in the closet. Unlike alcohol, which is a friend in your liquor cabinet, alternative will.Alternatively, Denver's 7 p.m. rule, including any amendment, is a form of command economy existing in socialist countries where businesses operate under strict guidelines of the state, guidelines that impede commerce, free trade and competition, thus creating black market economies.But Denver is a free market economy. There is a supply and demand economy functioning under necessarily minimal government regulation. Free market economies, unlike socialized command economies, foster competition resulting in better, cheaper goods and more jobs. And in the case of the marijuana industry, jobs that pay higher wages with benefits.Overly restricting marijuana dispensary hours is a socialist government intervention based on boogeymen in a closet, fear of increased crime. But stats show crime is on the decline. For over 40 years, I have been fortunate to have been an entrepreneur and business owner in Denver, a city in which I am privileged to pay my fair share of taxesand to provide jobs with benefits to my employees, allowing me to serve my community without the restrictive oversight of when I may open and close my business. I ask that City Council pass the bill as it stands, allowing businesses to operate from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m..Thank you.Thank you, Dr. Margie Valdez.Good evening, counsel. My name is Margie Valdez. I'm the chair of the AMC Entertainment Good Cooperation Zoning and Planning Committee. The Zoning and Planning Committee also has the responsibility for both alcohol, liquor and marijuana. At our February 25th, 2017 meeting, it was primarily focused on marijuana.We discussed the social consumption issues, and that took a great deal of time that even that morning after the social consumption discussion, we discussed the extension of hours for marijuana stores. One could almost say that after the social consumption, it would have been the ZAP committee members decision to oppose the anticipated bill for extension of hours.However, SAPP members are very, very astute. They understand the language, they understand the issues. We voted on the extension of hours to 10:00 at night. We felt like it was a fair compromise and that we did not discuss the extension of the hours, the 12 hours.I'm unable to speak to that tonight. We will be having that meeting on Saturday. I have always gone back to the delegates. I've always advised the delegates of what does that committee is recommended. And I we also post everything on our website.So we try to be as diplomatic and fair and transparent as the RNC can be. So with that, I, I can say that I can see that committee is in full support of the extension of hours till 10:00.Thank you very.Much. Thank you, Miss Valdez. Kate Gallagher, please say your first name, sir. Thank you. I'm Kevin Gallagher. I'm with the craft concentrates. We are headquartered here in Denver. I'm also with the Cannabis Business Alliance, and we are definitely in support of extending hours of operations for dispensaries here in Denver.I think it just all comes down to economic freedom. We should be treated just like any other business. And I think this is definitely the step in the right direction. I would really like to talk about Councilman Herndon's proposed amendment.We are very concerned with that. We think shifting hours is a terrible idea. We personally haven't heard any benefits from Councilman Hurd in that this would be a benefit. I'm not familiar with any other cities that have hours from 10 a.m. to ten p.I think that's very confusing for patients and customers alike. Also, many deliveries occur in the morning before 10 a.m. We like to deliver in the morning where it's safe. It's light outside. In the morning, there's less crime. So let's just make this more convenient for the consumers.Let's get the additional tax revenue. We also heard from Denver police and the mayor of Edgewater last meeting and they were no drawbacks with extending hours. So, again, we hope that you offer your support for extending hours from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m..Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Gallagher. Christie Kelly.Thank you again. Members of Council and Council President Brooks. My name is Christie Kelly and I'm the executive director of Marijuana Industry Group. I'm also a resident of Denver, and our organization is based in Denver. I have spoken with the other industry groups as well as a number of unaffiliated businesses in the city of Denver, as wellas our membership. And we are unified in support of council bills 17 324 that would allow licensed marijuana businesses to remain open from 10 a.m. or excuse me, from, from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.. We understand that there are amendments that are being considered that would contemplate further restrictions on the licenses.We welcome seeing those proposals and would happily entertain them at the point where they are proposed. However, in industry right now, there is unilateral support of the bill as it stands with Councilwoman Black's amendment as proposed today. I'd like to address the concern that was raised earlier today and in previous meetings about the earlier hours of operation, creating a portal for youth access. It's been a long time since I've been in high school or junior high school, but it's my understanding that in the city of Denver, junior high schools open sometime between 730 and 8 a.m..It's my understanding that in Denver, high schools open sometime between 730 and 7:45 a.m.. So consistent with our earlier chain of conversations, law abiding students, just like law abiding adults, should not be affected by a preservation of the ADA.Opening time for dispensaries. Thank you very much.All right. Thank you, Miss Kelly. Last but not least, Rodolfo Gonzalez. Number two. Okay. Thank you. All right. This concludes our speakers questions by members of council. All right. Council bill. The public hearing for Council Bill 324 is now closed.Comments by members of Council Councilman Blackwood. Would you. This is. This is your bill. Would you like to go first or.I've already said everything I need to say. Great. This is first reading, so hopefully we can save much of our discussion for next week. But thank you.Thank you, Councilman Ortega.So I first want to make a statement about an attack that was made on one of our speakers. And I think that's totally unfair. This is an open process where everybody has an opportunity to come and say their piece, and I particularly am grateful for the input that we have had from Smart, Colorado, because I know thatit is not always a comfortable position to be the sometimes the only voice in a room speaking on behalf of children and as a grandmother of small children, I think that the concern about the impact to our kids is is a real issue that we need to constantly be cognizant of.I'm not sure that we have really taken a careful look at any of the unintended consequences. You know, we know as a city we're spending a lot more money on our homeless shelters as a result of more young people who have moved here that have ended up homeless.So that's one unintended consequence. But I think that as a city, having a balanced discussion is an important part of this conversation. And to do it where it should only be the industry speaking and trying to dictate what they want is absolutely wrong.This is, you know, a forum where we always want to hear from all sides. And it's why I appreciate Councilwoman Black ensuring that we had a second public input session where we got to hear from folks from the community as well as industry folks.I think this is an industry that has, by and large done a good job and have followed the rules. I think as a city, we've been very generous. And just because state law allows something doesn't mean as a city, we have to do what state law says is allowable.And this is one industry where we know that because marijuana is not legal at the federal level, that we have the discretion to be stricter than what state law requires. So I'll save some of my additional comments for next week.But I do want to point one thing out, and that is that when you look at how many stores our neighboring jurisdictions have compared to Denver. Arvada doesn't have any. Aurora has 23. That's the largest number next to Denver.Then when you go down to Commerce City, they have four. Edgewater. They have six Inglewood. Three Federal Heights. Three Glendale. They have seven. Golden has one. Lakewood. They have 12. Lewis feel they have to. Mountain View has to.North Glenn has six. Thornton has seven. Wheat Ridge has five. Adams County has four. And Arapahoe County has two. Denver has 218. So when you look at that number, you know, requesting that we have the opportunity to ensure that those that are pending applications, those that are going through the review process, I don't think it's unreasonable toensure that they are in full compliance before we allow them to move forward. So I'm looking forward to further conversation next week. I'm going to abstain from the vote tonight because I want to be able to have the the further conversation on the two amendments that we're going to have next week.Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you. Thank you. Okay. We I, I appreciate that. We're in the council comment period and we got to keep it that way. Council. Councilman Herndon.Thank you, Mr. President. This is on publication, so we're making a decision whether or not to publish the bill. I am comfortable with that. So I'll be voting in support and I look forward to the more in-depth conversation we as a body can have about the two amendments coming forward next week.Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilman Herndon, Councilman Lopez.Thank you, President Brooks. You know, I. I wanted to make a comment. I wanted to make a comment before we. Move to the next part. On another day, we would actually I think we'll be more commenting on the on the amendments themselves.I don't want to comment on that. I don't want to comment on where we're at now. And I do understand I do understand the message and what folks have said in this in these chambers. And I do appreciate that.I absolutely do. You know, I've I keep saying this does sound like an old man. I start feeling like Charlie Brown and he was here. But I've been here to see this develop when it was, you know, Amendment 2064, the decriminalization, not necessarily in that order, but to regulate it from from day one.And you know, I have to I have to admit, I was very skeptical at first. Absolutely, very skeptical. But you got to understand, I grew up around the bad side of it. And before it was regulated, I grew up seeing the abuse, not just from from weed, I mean, from other substances.And it was, you know, like alcohol. Other drugs. I saw it. I lived it. I felt the effects of it as a kid. Right. People in my neighborhood being gunned down over stuff like that. And that's absolutely the lack of regulation.But it's also regulation that achieves a balance as well, too. There's a level of responsibility that we can't just go gung ho and say, okay, let's just do all of it all at once. Bam. You know, we're catching up to a very clumsy 80 some odd years of.Liquor regulation. That's still I think is is very antiquated because I think it's a it's a much more dangerous substance. My issue, my neighborhood has always been the over proliferation of liquor stores in the west side. And there's some people that may shake their heads.Well, it's just business. It's the economy. Don't mess with the business. Don't mess with with the market. We have to because sometimes it's unjust and it plays out in an unjust way. You try to find grocery stores in our neighborhood, you'll find more liquor stores.And that's not right. So, yes, our regulations have to have to come into play in our actions on this dais and with and folks in the excise and license have to do it as well, too. But like I said, I started with skepticism.But I find myself now when I meet with colleagues from around the country and other city councils and other counties in other states. Being a champion of what we do here in Denver. Hearing their fears, hearing their hysteria kind of is like, oh, we've been there, done that.Don't worry, it doesn't create crime. It actually reduces it. And that's the message that we're able to do. But it takes time and it takes time for any for whatever your cause may be. It takes time to convince people of that cause their own personal experience, their own hands in it, their ability to actually see it rightand see how the system works. And it's working. I mean, there's a lot of kinks, don't get me wrong. There's there's a lot of little there's some minor minutia. And we'll expect this. And we said this a while back that we'll expect something like this.We expect to be tinkering with this as we go. But my point is, is that look. The hours are being extended. That's a plus. As a testament to the industry, to the responsibility, to those standards that are being upheld.It's a testament to our ability to regulate it. And you're always going to have different amendments and different ideas and different ways to tinker with it in this dais. And it should not be limited. I had a we had a bunch of folks up here that were growers.Not very many of them lived in Denver. We're very reflective of the of the makeup of Denver. Not very many people of color out here. Right. And under those stanzas, they get the heck out of here. Go to your own cities.No, we heard everybody. Right. And that's that's what I want folks to understand, is this is this isn't just something that happens in a vacuum. This is something that has been we've been working on and working on and trying to achieve this.But at the end of the day, use my example. Right? I have my own personal feelings about it. I have my own personal experiences about it. Not always positive, but it's not about what I believe personally. It's about what we can achieve as a city to achieve that balance and move forward.Because I think we are absolutely headed in the right direction. Having said that, I can't wait to debate the merits of the other amendments and everything else and hear from people in our next go round and city council.Appreciate it. Thanks for bringing the bill forward and I'm glad to be part of it moving forward.Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilman Espinosa. Yeah. I wanted it first thing, Councilwoman Ortega for her comments. The. You know, we keep talking about marijuana, marijuana, marijuana and marijuana. And I think we approved that overwhelmingly a couple of times.I don't have that level of approval in my district the way we voted for legalization on this issue. And it comes from for a reason. We don't have always the best actors in this industry operating their businesses. It is a position of privilege with this finite, limited number of licenses that it is too burdensome to operate withextended hours, whatever, in whatever capacity or or later hours if it's not extended hours. There are plenty of people waiting to take those licenses and operate that business for you. That said, we're not just talking about marijuana. We're talking when we legalized marijuana, we legalized THC.And we are getting concentrations and dosages that are off the charts. Nothing like what you smoked in the seventies. You know, this is and that's legal and it's being sold. And people are dosing far more than what you would get in a through a through a joint.And so there are consequences there unintended consequences. And so I think being sensible, reasonable and expanding our businesses opportunities rationally is perfectly sensible. And, you know, it is not like any other business. You can't take your credit card payment.You can't do this. You can't do that. It's not it's not selling jewelry. It's not. I mean, it's close because there's still a lot of the security related, but it's not. So I do I just want to be mindful of that, that as much as somebody from a with a different vantage than me, I never I neverwas six feet tall or white or black or anything else. I mean, I would have a different perspective. And so that's what we do when we're sitting here. We try to take in as many perspectives as possible, at least I do, as a representative of of 50,000 plus people.I need to understand where everybody is coming from to make a more measured and calculated and reasonable and rational decision. And I would expect you to want us to do that across the board. I try to. So with that said, I forgot to ask a question.So to the gentleman, I won't ask you the question. Now, I'm going to ask you the question, but I'd like you to follow up with me on email, because I didn't understand the comments about deliveries because I just didn't know if, like other businesses, they can take deliveries during their non operating hours.I didn't know if that was it was a delivery service or actually picking up stuff or there were limitations. So if you could explain that, I would truly appreciate that. Thanks. With that, I'll look forward to the next meeting.Thanks. Thank you. Councilman Espinoza, seeing no other comments, I'll just add to this is it's a fascinating conversation. I am a little bit like Councilman Lopez since the adoption. I've been in an incredible evolution of this. And I've come quite a ways as well with with three young kids and neighbors that partake regularly.You guys remember those who have been on who were on the council prior when we had the conversation about smoking on your porch, you remember that conversation that happens in my neighborhood all the time. But my kids are okay.They're eight, five and ten years old. They're okay. They're doing great, actually. And we've had great conversations around this. And I understand the fear and the paranoia if you don't engage and if you're not in a community like that.But I've come a long way personally. We up here have two conversations that are always there. We're always talking about it's a policy conversation and it's political. The policy conversation is. Should we take the hours and make it parallel with the state?And it's kind of a funny conversation because me being honest, Denver is always ahead of the state in many things, much more progressive than the state here where we're a little bit behind. But should we? The policy question, should we match?Are ours with the state? And then a political question of what does the what can the community endure? What, what, what's pal palatable to the community? And that's what we always must have the conversation around if the bill before us is extending to 10 p.m..And I believe. We have the 10 p.m. time because that's what's palatable to the community. There's there's not a whole lot of policy for me, a whole lot of strong policy conversations around why not ten? Because why not 12?The state is set at 12. Why not? Give this business. Their legal rights as we give other businesses, too, to be said at 12:00. So it's just a question for for me to to give to counsel as we are considering this for another week and considering the amendments.What what is the policy reasoning for 10 p.m.? And let's make sure we know what it is and not just. Oh, I think everybody. I think that's a fair. Placement of time for this community, in this community and the community at large.I want us to really think about that. I'll be voting in favor of this and look forward to the debate next week. Madam Secretary, roll call.Councilor. Councilman, you need to make a motion. To order, publishers amended.Oh, yes. Thank you, Madam Secretary.Thank you, Mr. President.

District three.Thank you. I'm gonna have a motion on a second about Councilman Price. I think we're gonna hear from Mr. Lopez. Or did you want to start off, Councilwoman?No, I was going to ask staff if they could give us an update on this item.Okay, great. So turn this over to Mr. Lopez.Thank you, honorable mayor, members of the City Council, we are happy to announce that we have substantially completed the construction of the Naples Island Permanent Seawalls Repairs Phase one project and have reopened the northeast quadrant that will allow the canal and the adjacent sidewalks to for public access.The additional contract authority that's being requested today will allow us to fully complete the project and be able to tie some loose ends and fully complete all construction activities at the site. That concludes Steve's.Report.Thank you. Thank you to Eric Lopez and Rachel Tanner for the update and for the amazing work that you guys have done on this project. It's been outstanding. And I want to thank resident who is here today, Maureen Po, for her 20 plus years of work on this project.And of course, my predecessor, Gary DeLong, for his work on this project as well. As you know, this project had been approved prior to me coming into office, but I've had the pleasure of working alongside city staff when the when the project commenced and then when phase one was completed just last week.On Saturday, the mayor and I had the pleasure of celebrating the grand reopening of the Naples canals. The rebuilding of phase one of the seawall started last December with demolition of the old concrete cap and sidewalk, installing 47 feet long steel sheet piles, redoing the drainage system, pouring new sidewalks and adding new lighting and benches.The canals provide a unique recreational opportunity that is special and a defining part of the Naples community and the city of Long Beach as a whole. People come from all over the region to kayak, stand up, paddle board or take a gondola ride through our charming canals.The Naples Improvement Association is gearing up for the 69th Annual Boat Parade on Saturday, December 12th. I hope residents from all over the city visit the canals during this holiday season to see the new infrastructure as well as the wonderful holiday decorations that the Naples community is known for and takes great, great pride in.I'd like to just ask for your indulgence for a few minutes to show a short video that staff has put together showing the work on phase one of the seawall. Okay. But.That is quick turnaround.That was great video. I like that song. Very catchy. And I have to say, it was a very I told the group it was an unexpectedly romantic morning with the mayor on a gondola at the height the tide was high.So the boat that we were originally going to be on couldn't make it under the bridge. So it was a fantastic event. Again, staff's done an amazing job. My team, the third district office team, of course, Julie's been on this project for many years.Christina Duggan from my office has been attending the monthly meetings, and we've worked very closely with the Naples Improvement Association. So it's been a wonderful partnership. And, you know, I just want to make sure that everybody is clear that this is a project that really, you know, but for the special care that went into some of theselections, like the lighting and the the palm trees and some of the special touches really was, you know, proceeded very well and efficiently and within the budget. And so all the extra time and money that's being spent on it is really being being done to make sure that it the project ended on a positive note and thatthe residents were happy with the final outcome. So thank you staff for making that happen and for the amazing outreach that you did throughout this project. You guys did a great job. I hope every project is just like that.Thank you.Thank you. Any public comment on the item? Please come forward.Very good you. I don't live down around that area, but I fully support the use of public monies for that. And some people may not understand why if. You don't live around the water. Imagine if there were an earthquake and your big gap appeared and you're down the center of your street and the city decided not todo anything about that. Eventually, the foundation of your house may take a couple of years, but would collapse. So too would it be here if the seawall gives way. Those homes would get flooded out, the foundations would be eviscerated, and eventually it would destroy that tax base.And the tax base within that area is almost equivalent to I don't know what the exact figures are, but it would dwarf almost, I think, one or two tax bases of this district in other parts of the city and so forth.Beyond that, once that goes, the commercial area on Second Street would go within Naples. I do have concerns. I want to make sure there's some clarifications. It's my understanding this is phase one and phase two. Is that allowed to begin now or is that the one where the Corps of Engineers comes down and says, no further workon the sea walls unless and until the Sorento pathway is completed? There was an article in the paper in that and I think I saw something like that in the permit. But that needs to be clarified because the Corps of Engineers, I've asked for the inspector general, the Corps of Engineers, to get inside and make an orderdo that, because I can, as my factory senses, tell me there's going to be a problem with the Sorento. Pathway easily addressed, but you'd have to have the right type of management to do that, and I'm not sure we have that in place right now.So I think that needs to be clarified when if this first phase is all work, stop. And I think the Naples people need to know that there's a stop right now at the end of this phase and wait until Sorrento or are they allowed to go through a phase two period?And the last thing I question, quite frankly, in the order to get inside of it, why, when we're talking about the billions, the millions we're talking about, an additional $300,000 is needed. Something's wrong there. You know, the olfactory sense of it is going into high gear.Thank you.Thank you. Next speaker, please.He was dancing down there. That's.Maureen Po one four, four, seven. A walk. Thank you for providing an opportunity for me to come and talk to you all today, because you have all been part of the rebuild of the the Naples Sea walls for over 20 years.I've been the chairman of the committee, but it's a committee of volunteers, people who wanted to get together and help and work with the city. And we've had a remarkable time. And the result is what you saw in that beautiful video.And I was presented this afternoon with a booklet from one of the homeowners that were so grateful. And they took pictures during the whole trip, and they have more pictures to bring to me. But they just wanted to let me know how much it meant to them to have a safe wall.And I know that as you have looked at the rains and the decomposing of the sea walls down in South Carolina, I went to bed sleeping better, thinking, well, our walls are getting fixed and they're not just getting a new rod put in that could hold a little bit and then have the wall crumble.They're actually getting new stainless steel walls that will be there for 70 years. And so I won't be here to worry about it the second time around. I think that it's going to last longer than that. But we really had a public and city project because I know that Eric Lopez and Rachel Tanner have been with usall the way through. And I we had a whole lot of other people that had worked in their positions that came back to see the grand opening of the seawalls. Susie Price has made herself available at any hour.I can send her a message and I know she'll get back to me within a half hour. She stays up late just to make sure that she keeps us in touch. And I know that the mayor, he worked hard before he became mayor and when he was on the Coastal Commission to provide a way for us tosee a mitigation that could occur with the Sorento trail is one of those things that he helped with. He had the insight to to be able to work with that, because I know it took me three years of meeting over and over and again with the Coastal Commission to make sure that they were aware of the projectand how much we were in need of it. And so I just thank you very much for everything that you've done, and it's been a pleasure to work with the city on this project.Thank you. I'll repeat in a maureen what we we said over the weekend, it would not be possible without you and obviously the whole committee. So thank you for your for your work. There's very work in the committee's work and it's been fantastic.So with that, there's a motion and a second on any of the public comment.

Honorable vice mayor and members of the city council approve was requested to enter into a contract with Jacques Architects Inc for architectural and engineering services for the Lifeguard Headquarters, Rehabilitation and Junior Lifeguard Facility Rebuild Projects.We will explore options to rehabilitate the lifeguard headquarters facility and to rebuild the junior lifeguard building where a new facility new. Both efforts will include a comprehensive planning and outreach process. That concludes the recommendation.Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.Thank you. I want to thank the staff for bringing this item forward and for the all the effort that I know you've already put into this and that you're going to put into this. The only request that I have is that I know there are a lot of stakeholders involved in this, including the lifeguards.And so, if possible, you know, the more outreach that we can do with the stakeholders to make sure that this facility that they're going to be using primarily fits their needs and suits their use and intended purpose. That would be great because it's much harder to go back after the fact and tweak a design than to haveeveryone at the same place at the table when the design is being initiated.

    "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThank you. Then Councilman Mungo wanted to pull the health order item. Can we read that, please, Madam Clerk? And then I don't know if we just can go right into Councilman Mango. Thank you.Report from City Manager Recommendation to confirm city manager's. Promulgation of the revised Safer Home Health Order issued on October one, 2020, by the City of Long Beach Health Officer as a regulation citywide.Thank you. I know that there are lots of different aspects of the health order that are currently. Supporting and challenging to our local businesses and in meeting with local businesses throughout the district. I've heard from the community how great development services has been in their education and outreach.However, the Department of Development Services is limited in the flexibility that they can provide to any of these businesses because of the way that the health order is written at the state level. There are some things that I've discussed with development services staff over the last several weeks, including up to even earlier today, related to some specificsof the health order that are disproportionately impacting certain businesses, while not impacting other businesses that provide the exact same service. And so for that reason, I cannot support that certain businesses are able to be open and available and providing certain services, while other businesses who provide the exact same services, but in a different context, are not ableto provide that same service. I've met with and gotten an opinion from the city attorney that was forwarded. Thank you, Linda Tatum. But at this time, I will once again be voting no on the enforcement of this, particularly for those businesses that are providing exact same services as other businesses that are allowed to be open while certainbusinesses are not because of the the specifics of how the health orders is written. So I'll continue to advocate for the health of our community and the health of those residents that are not being able to participate in certain health related services in a non health environment because costs are lower.And I will continue to work with development services on any potential changes that can be made that are within our authority. Though I am very aware, as are our businesses, that we have very little flexibility on this matter.Thank you.Thank you. And Councilwoman Rice.Thank you. So I'm a little bit confused. I'm not sure if that's what this item calls for. I mean, as a business owner, I disagree with many of the orders. So I certainly hope that by voting for this item, we're not endorsing the health orders and the types of businesses that have been deemed safe while other businesseshave been deemed unsafe. So if I could get a clarification from the city attorney or perhaps the city manager, is that what we're voting on? Because I don't believe the health order is written in a manner that's fair to businesses, and I don't want to imply that through my vote.So, no, the way that it has been set up in the emergency powers that you've delegated the city manager, and then you subsequently change that ordinance, what you vote on now every time as we bring you the promulgation of the health order.So the health officer has the official responsibility under state law and they make those decisions in their medical opinion on how to craft a health order in alignment with the state order. Then I, I implement that and so I implement it and then I bring it to you.So what this is a vote on is the enforcement ability of the city manager. So if the whole council were to not approve this, the health order would remain. There just would not be a enforcement mechanism for the health order.Thank you.Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Price. Councilman. No.Exactly. Thank you, Mr. Modica. And so my concern is that we can enforce in certain businesses and we would not. Be in any mechanism to enforce and other businesses that provide a same service in a health environment versus a non health environment.And so for those reasons, I am voting no on the enforcement component because of these types of specific nuances. And so in my mind, if those types of services are available in our city, then they should be available by any business that can meet the requirements despite what their classification is.So that that's why I asked it to be pulled, so that I could voice that specific concern as the businesses have asked me to do.Okay. Thank you. Councilman Price.Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So just for clarification and I get where Councilmember Mongo is coming from. I actually 100% wholeheartedly agree with her on this because the way the health orders are written, it's really difficult to fathom how certain activities are being considered.Not risky and other activities are being designated as risky. And so I agree with you. I really don't think the the city or the state, frankly, should be picking winners and losers in terms of businesses. My only concern and I think councilmember member and I might be the only ones who feel this way and I appreciate yousharing that because I agree with you. But if all nine of us were to not approve this, does that mean then movie theaters could open or concert venues could open in Long Beach and we wouldn't be able to enforce.The answer to that. The city. Tony Perkins The answer to that is no. The state is regulating it. This would if every councilmember or there's a majority voted against this, the city would lack the ability to enforce it.Enforce any violation of the state order.Of the city's.Health order. Yes.The city's health order. Okay. Got it. Thank you.Okay. Thank you.Did you call me Mr. Mayor? I can't hear you now.I count. Compliments of the house.Thank you.Thank you, Mayor. I just wanted a little bit more clarification here. I know that one of the things that my constituents are really concerned about is the safety and the health of the families of residents that live in the district.I'm coming from a district representing a district where the majority well, not the majority, but we have very high, high positivity rates in in this district. You know, this makes me nervous. I think that it's important that we have enforcement.But, you know, for for these businesses. But I would like a little bit more clarification, if possible, on I don't understand how they say that some businesses are, you know, are able to operate under a health order and some that do the exact same thing are not.So if I could get clarification on that, please.Mr. Modica.So I believe one of the examples might be medical massage. So under the state order, from the very beginning of if there are certain medical uses, like a massage that's happening in a medical office that has been considered an essential service, there are groups that make the argument that the same types of services can be done ina in an office building. That's not a medical. The state has basically said those are considered personal care and those need to be closed. But if it were in a medical situation, that might be an example of those services.There's not that many of those. There are some. But I also just want to add that, you know, our approach to enforcement has really been education. We do lots of inspections. We talk to a lot of people. To date, we've done 11,628 inspections and issued 72 citations so that we're getting compliance without having to do a lotof enforcement. But we are making sure that people are operating safely and in alignment with the state order.Thank you for for that, Tom. I really appreciate that clarification. And one of the things that I have seen is that I have seen you being very active in the First District. And I think that if we really want to get to a point that we move forward and and open up as a city, we really haveto have enforcement for the reasons that we don't want this pandemic to continue. We don't want this spread to continue. And I think that that's the the important thing is that we don't want our businesses to continue to have to be closed.But if we if we don't enforce them, we are most likely going to be seeing those businesses continue to be closed and maybe even take us to a deeper shutdown. So thank you for that clarification.Thank you. I'm going to go back to the council on Mongo and then Councilwoman Brice.Thank you. I think that comes from Mr. Moto because examples exemplary. So to miss that they has this point. If a community member goes to a chiropractic office and gets a massage or goes to a massage facility, or if a person a great example is my my godfather, he is in Orange County.So he's not in a position like this. But it was brought to my attention that he's in physical therapy and his physical therapist can choose to work out of a medical facility, but that same physical therapist works out of a small gym.And so if he were to get the cash rate of going to a small gym for that physical therapy, then he that's not eligible right now. But in Long Beach, we could not do that unless there were certain conditions met.Some gyms are able to move outside, but some have not. And then in this particular case, to Councilman's and day house's point, the activity is no more risky. And so in my mind, I'd like to vote no that the city manager not enforce fines on businesses that are providing services that somewhere under the health order are allowedas long as those businesses are providing them in a healthy manner, if they are not providing them in a healthy manner in alignment with the other business that's able to do it, then absolutely. Yes, we should follow through on that type of enforcement.But the way that the the current enforcement order is written, the city attorney and the city manager isn't the one picking winners or losers, losers he's enforcing across the board. It's the governor's order. And so I would love to see some kind of specificity where if the activity is already deemed appropriate in some place, in the orderthat it be a lower focus level of our department, and so that those businesses could work through what would be possible. Similar to we worked really hard for four bars and breweries when they were not allowed to be open, and yet in some cases they felt as though they were in the exact or similar situations as restaurants. Then you have the medical marijuana versus regular marijuana. Why is it that an individual who may have a medical need for marijuana but chooses not to go through the inconvenience of getting a card, would not be able to get their medicine.The actual process of getting the product in alignment with what Councilman Sunday has said is no more risky and therefore provides no additional risk or safety to our community. And so for those reasons, on the current order, I will be voting no.And if I hope there are enough councilmembers that feel similarly that we in Long Beach could potentially set an example on how to enforce in the most egregious ways and other egregious acts that are completely forbidden under the order and provide health risks versus these other types of reasons that we potentially wouldn't want to do as muchenforcement. I think that we could be an example because again, as stated in the health order, those specific services do not. Seem to constitute a risk under that methodology. Thank you.That's bigger than our last or last communism. I'm impressed.Thank you. Very well stated. Councilmember Mongo, I'm going to be supporting your position on this and perhaps we can consider fashioning a friendly down the road or if someone has one tonight that articulates that. Here's there's a lots of categories of businesses that fall into the exact situation that the city manager and council member Mungo mentioned.If it's done under the operation, under the direction of a doctor, for example, anything is is allowed. So if we have a dermatologist, for example, people can go in and get facials, they can get wax treatments, they can get, you know, all manner of treatments that you don't have to have a dermatologist give that and they're availableby us dieticians, but they can't get them done because there's no doctor on site. And even then I don't even think there needs to be a doctor on site, but the facility is a medical facility. So I think there's a lot and you know, we I just spent 45 minutes the other day on the phone with thesesmall business owners who own a very small Pilates studio where they help a lot of people that have sports injuries. They're not chiropractors, but they they're not physical therapists, but they're thinking about re categorizing because they can't pay their rent.Their landlord isn't helping them at all. They were in tears, frustrated, because if they were categorized as physical therapists and associated with a physical therapist, then they would be able to do exactly what it is. It's being done at physical therapy studios that have parties, machines.And so I agree with Council member Mungo. I realize that we haven't been instituting a lot of fines and I get that. But I think it's the optics and it's just a fairness issue. If it's done under the umbrella of a doctor, then how is the contact that's considered risky allowed?And that contact outside a medical scenario, the same exact combat contact with the same precautions is considered more risky. It just seems to me that and I get it, it's the way the health order is written, which is probably why most jurisdictions aren't filing any criminal sanctions associated with violations of the state order.But it's the way the order is written. It's not the way the city has implemented the order. So I agree with Councilmember Mungo and I think there's just a lot of equities at play here. We talk a lot about equity and I really think it's important for us to think about how these orders are affecting individual businessowners who are engaged in behavior and conduct that the state has deemed actually totally acceptable in certain settings and not in others. So thank you.Thank you, Councilman Richardson. Thank you. So I don't.I hear one motion on the floor. Is that correct?Actually, I don't think there is. I don't think I actually heard a motion, actually.Okay. It sounds like.I took the number. I took this off consent calendar, so we had a motion to approve the item.Okay. It sounded like a few people just want the opportunity to vote no. I'm going to make the staff recommendation of the motion to approve the staff recommendation. Thank you.Thank you. Okay.Before but let me let me say this. Let me say this, Mr. Mayor. I actually think that there there should be more discussion on this in the future and that we should revisit revisit this. I think as we move forward, we should be able to understand fully the, you know, where we are with the health orders andthese changes. So we should think about making some back on consent to get up to speed on where we are on some of these things. So but I do move staff recommendation right now. Thank you.Thank you. We're going to go ahead. And Councilwoman Price, did you two back up?I did. I did have one question. I wasn't expecting to be talking about it tonight. But I just out of curiosity, I know that we've been called since day one, but the council, as the legislative body, really has no say whatsoever in the state orders.But then I was curious, because I know the L.A. Board of Supervisors weighed in on the state health order when it decided to open certain businesses that were allowed to be opened under state directives. And so their legislative body, which which would be analogous to our legislative body for our jurisdiction, did weigh in on the state healthorder and open up categories of businesses that the state had deemed okay for statewide openings. Why? Can you can someone explain that to me? Because I've been told from day one that the legislative body has no jurisdiction to weigh in at all on what business sectors we open.But it sounds like a different legislative body did. So I'm not sure if they have something specific in their articles that allows them to do it. And we can't.Mr. Modica.So we wonder that as well, we actually don't believe they do have that authority, that they are essentially doing that. And then their CEO and their health order health officer needs to make a decision on whether they're going to support what the board wants to do or not.So that is not how they have operated in the past. That has been a fairly recent occurrence. And that we believe, at least I'm looking at the city attorney. We believe that the in the state law, it is the health officer in their sole discretion that has the ability to put in a health order.And again, even if the board wants to change things, they cannot change things that you know or get that direction to the health officer. The health officer is still bound by the state health order and cannot go beyond that.Right. But they're able to operate within the state health order, even though we haven't advanced to the next tier to move us forward in certain business sectors. Or at least that's what they did.So I think they our interpretation is they asked their health officer to go, you know, within the purple tier to open certain things up in the purple tier that had not been opened up before. I do want to point out, we believe as Long Beach, we have opened everything in the purple tier that applies to us.So we are essentially have everything open. And again, we can't move forward into the red tier, into L.A. County as numbers hit the red tier.Okay. So. So nail salons and breweries and wineries were in the purple tier. And indoor shopping malls and card rooms. Those were specifically called out in the purple tier.I believe so.If it was.I believe so.Okay.And so L.A. County has in certain areas been stricter than what the state has allowed, you know, in and in order to, you know, basically try to keep the numbers down as low as possible. And part of their philosophy is they can get more businesses open if they can get the numbers down.So trying to to keep things to a point where the case loads go down, the positivity rates go down so that they can actually make it into red to be able to open more things.Okay. So I guess my question should be then how are those specific businesses called out in the purple tier? Like how does a card room, for example, get in the purple tier and. I don't know. A facial doesn't like.How does that is there someone lobbying for that? That seems to me like kind of a random, you know, card room or winery or brewery. So is it because someone's lobbying for those things? How's that.Happen? Yes, that was definitely a lobbying thing. I think that was done over the objection of the public health department. And again, it's not all done in indoors. That's all outdoors only. So none of those things were allowed to be brought indoors.They have to be outdoors. And the health officer is still enforcing that. They have to be open on three sides. I think some of the card rooms I read tried to open up and just put a tent outside and that was enclosed.And so the health order health officer is still enforcing those things. So, yes, we do believe that was a number of cities that were asking for the ability to operate outdoors like a massage parlor can or any type of personal services.Right. Except for nail salons, which someone has deemed that digging into someone's nails with sharp objects is less risky than giving them a facial.Yes, that came from the state. So that's not a local decision that the state allowed, did not originally allow nail salons in purple and then they allowed nail salons in purple.Okay. But the but the card room designation and purple that came from the state, not the county.I believe so. So the county I believe the state allowed and we haven't followed courtrooms that much because we don't have card room. So. But I do believe that that was allowed in purple. But the county was not allowing it to open even because they have that discretion.So they then allowed card rooms to open outdoors.Okay. All right. Well, I mean, I guess my my whole point in all of this is that there's some lobbying efforts going on somewhere. And my concern is that, you know, the small mom and pop businesses who don't have a lobbyist or aren't in an industry that has lobbyists are maybe getting forgotten.And I realize our numbers are going up. I get that. But I think it should be a shared burden by every business. So I get it. And I understand. I'm just I'm just trying to maybe point out that.Councilwoman Price, your time expired.Okay, thank you. I have nothing further.And if I can just add, this council is very good at passing on information from businesses and asking questions, and we do everything we can to try to accommodate them where we can within the state health order. So I don't want anyone listening to think that their council is not, you know, passing those on.And they certainly are. And we address those as best as we can.Thank you. I exhausted the council comments. I want to make a few comments and then we'll go to the vote. There's a motion on the floor. Just more broadly speaking, I think it's just important to note that we are in the purple category, which is the most widespread category, as is, of course, most of the larger countiesin the state of California. And everything that is open right now in Long Beach, as is things that are open in the county, are all allowed within that purple tier. And so there aren't business sectors that are allowed by the state that somehow the city of Long Beach, along with the county, have an open.I think, Tom, you mentioned that it's more of a kind of clarify that point. Obviously. In addition, I want to obviously, I think people can have different opinions on this issue and different thoughts. I think we've heard some some tonight as well.Some there's a lot of all of us have concerns for small businesses and how these decisions are being made. Obviously, the decisions from the tier category and what goes where are decisions made essentially in the Department of Health and Dr. Ghaly his team.And then, of course, they go through their process in meeting with all of the affinity groups and get input, of course, from from the, the hospitals and all the folks that are involved in those decisions as that data is being collected from from the ground.I think it's also safe to say that this is not a perfect science and in no way is are we getting every decision the right way? I think the governors even said so. You know that there's a lot that we are learning and have learned in the past.The last thing I'll say is that I do strongly support this motion. I think the more cautious that we can be, the better.The.Time needs to have. The ability, Mr. America, to enforce enforcement is important. And at a moment in the state where we are beginning to see cases and particularly this country rise in 20 to 23 states in the nation, this is going to impact us as we go into the fall with flu season.And so I worry about where we're going to be if we don't continue to take this incredibly seriously. And I know everyone on this council takes this very seriously, but I do support this motion, and I think it should be adopted.And so with that, we will call the roll call vote.We have a second year on this motion, Mayor.

Okay, Councilman Espinosa, will you please put Council Bill 55 on the floor? Thank you, Mr. President. I move that council bill 55 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.It has been moved and it the public hearing for counsel, bill 55 is open. May we have the staff report? Tracy Huggins, it's good to see you.Good evening, Mr. President. Members of City Council. My name is Tracy Huggins. I am the executive director of the Denver Urban Renewal Authority here this evening to request of City Council your consideration of an amendment to the St Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan to add the Sloan's BLOCK three project and to create the Sloan's BLOCK three sales taxincrement areas. The scene at the Urban Redevelopment Area was established following City Council approval in July of 2013 and is comprised of approximately 32 acres generally bounded by Stewart Street on the west west Colfax Avenue on the South Perry Street on the East and West 17th Avenue on the North.The majority of the urban redevelopment area was occupied by the Saint Anthony Central Hospital campus prior to its closure. The redevelopment of the former hospital campus is primarily supported by two metropolitan districts, which use additional property taxes levied on the property to finance a variety of infrastructure improvements.Even with the use of metropolitan district financing, there was concern that the key objectives of the redevelopment plans could go unrealized without potential gap financing to support catalytic projects along West 17th Avenue and along West Colfax Avenue. In particular, the Colfax Parcel or BLOCK seven was challenged by difficulty in attracting new neighborhoods, serving retail to a largelyblighted stretch of West Colfax and the anticipated extraordinary cost to support structured parking to meet the urban design objectives of Main Street zoning. The potential gap financing for the common parcel or BLOCK three was driven by a desire to preserve a 1939 structure that requires extraordinary abatement and renovation, including a complete replacement and mechanical systems historically servedby the main hospital. Central Plan. With those concerns in mind. City Council approved the Urban Redevelopment Plan, which encompasses the nine blocks noted in this diagram. Council also approved the creation of a property tax increment area that is coterminous with the metropolitan district boundaries.Any property tax increment generated within the property tax increment area can only be utilized on approved projects. To date, council has approved two projects within the urban redevelopment area. Thus the BLOCK seven West Project, which will be the future home of the Alamo Drafthouse Theater.Miss Hawkins? Yes. Our, uh, you know, illumination has gone there, so if you could tell us the pages that you're on, that'd be helpful.Do you? The pages of.What?Mr. President, of this. So do you see this on your. On your screen?Some of us do. Does everybody have one? This one's on.The back.One. I will not be offended at all if you choose to turn around and look at your monitors instead of facing me.Okay. I think. I think some of us have enough.Yeah. They're not on there.Yeah, we have.Just like you have the slide slides. So I actually. Maybe I can do this. I believe I am on slide four.Okay, great.Do you want to give me a head? Not if you're. If you're with me on slide four, make sure we're synched up.Is that three or four on an hour's, guys? Four. Okay.So far, so good on slide four. Yeah.Okay. Go ahead.All right. All right.So, to date, council has approved two projects within the urban redevelopment area, the Sloan's BLOCK Seven West Project, which will be the future home of the Alamo Drafthouse Theater and the BLOCK seven East Project, which includes the redevelopment of the existing Raleigh Office Building and the construction of new retail along Colfax.Those projects were approved by City Council in January of 2015. The project, being considered this evening through an amendment to the Urban Redevelopment Plan, is the redevelopment of BLOCK three, which is generally bordered by West 17th Avenue, Perry Street, West 16th Avenue and Quitman Street.This launch block three project site covers an entire block within the urban redevelopment area and includes the existing vacant former nurse's dormitory, the Coleman Building and auditorium building. So I'm now on Slide six. So still with me?Yup.All right. So the BLOCK three project would include the following components. Rehabilitation of the 44,000 square foot historic Coleman building, a former nurse's dormitory into multifamily, affordable housing rehabilitation of the auditorium attached to the Coleman building into a 5000 square foot retail and or restaurant space.Construction of a new 2200 square foot single storey retail building. Construction of approximately 25 new market rate townhomes. Construction of a 4300 square foot public plaza, as well as the installation of streets, utilities and public space within the site, as well as storm drainage facilities for block three and adjacent blocks.So I'll touch on each of those components briefly. As far as the affordable housing, as part of the implementation of the previously negotiated affordable housing plan for the Saint Anthony site, the six story Coleman building will be redeveloped to include 49 affordable units.The building amenities will include an onsite leasing office community room with an entertainment area and kitchenette, as well as a fitness center. The building will have 30 reserved surface parking spaces and an additional 15 reserve parking spaces in the existing parking garage that is located on BLOCK five.This slide and I'm now on slide number eight provides a breakdown of the unit mix in the Coleman building. As you can see, of the 49 total units, three will be studios. 37 will be one bedroom, and the remaining nine units will be two bedroom.This slide also provides the expected expected rents for the various types of units, as well as the current income guidelines for persons at 60% of area median income. Or am I? I will note that this project did receive 4% low income housing tax credits through their application to the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority.So the income will be limited to 60% of AM I. On Slide nine, we show the retail, restaurant and Public Plaza components of the project. As I noted previously, it will include new retail, restaurant and public spaces. The renovated Coleman Auditorium building will include 5000 square feet of retail and or restaurant space.There will also be new construction at the corner of West 17th Avenue and Perry Street to provide an additional 2200 square feet of retail and restaurant space, along with a new 4300 square foot public plaza. These uses will be supported by approximately 32 parking spaces on block three.This project will also include for sale housing by virtue of the sale of approximately 25 for sale market rate townhomes. These townhomes will be three and four stories and will will face West 17th Avenue, Quitman Street and West 16th Avenue.Each townhome will have either one or two garage parking for their homeowners. The Urban Redevelopment Plan authorizes Jerry to finance projects within the urban redevelopment area by use of tax increment financing. The plan amendment will authorize the use of property tax increment financing as well as to add the loans.BLOCK three sales tax increment areas. Doris Gaff has done a thorough underwriting of the project and has reviewed the redevelopment budget and performance submitted by the developer and believes there is a financial gap in the project of approximately $6.5 million.This amount is subject to change based on the final pricing of those 4% low income housing tax credits. This financing gap will be addressed by reimbursing eligible costs through sales and property tax increment generated by the redevelopment of the property that is block three as well as amounts from the broader property tax increment area.Following redevelopment, the site is anticipated to generate approximately $120,000 per year in net property tax increment and approximately $95,000 per year in net sales tax increment. This amount of increment being generated from block three alone would not be sufficient to repay the entire $6.5 million financing gap in the project.Therefore, the incremental tax revenues from block three will be supplemented by taking an amount from the property tax that is generated through the development of blocks one, two and four of about $850,000 per year. And those amounts, again in combination will be used to reimburse the developer for those eligible expenses over a period not to exceed 25years. In approving the Saint Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan, City Council found the Urban Redevelopment Plan to be in conformance with the Denver Comprehensive Plan 2000 and its applicable supplements. Accordingly, any amendment to the Urban Redevelopment Plan must be in conformance with the Urban Redevelopment Plan objectives in order to maintain the continuing conformance with comp plan 2000.The general objectives of the Saint Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan are to reduce or eliminate blighted conditions and to stimulate the continued growth and development of the urban redevelopment area. The proposed project meets the following objectives of the Saint Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan to eliminate the present and growing factors which contribute to blight in the urban redevelopment area. To renew and improve the character and environment of the area and its surroundings by preventing or ameliorating economic, physical and environmental deterioration. To encourage residential retail and commercial development and redevelopment that is socially and economically inclusive and from which the urban redevelopment area and its environs can draw economic strength to encourage and protect existing development within andimmediately adjoining the area by creating conditions from which these areas can draw new economic strength to more effectively use under to more effectively use underdeveloped land within the area to encourage land use patterns within the area where pedestrians are safe and welcome to promote a diverse mix of dense housing options to encourage re-use of existing buildings whereappropriate, including adaptive reuse. To promote a diverse, sustainable near neighborhood economy, including mixed use and commercial development opportunities within the urban redevelopment area, and to improve access to healthy transportation options and existing parks. In approving the proposed amendment to the Urban Redevelopment Plan.There are a number of legislative findings that city council must make. Those include the finding that the Sloan's BLOCK three project is located within the Saint Anthony Urban Redevelopment Area and will promote the objectives set forth in the Saint Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan.Also, finding that a feasible method exists for relocation of displaced individuals and families and business concerns. The project area contains no residences, therefore no individuals or families will be displaced. Additionally, due to the vacancy of the site, no business concerns will be displaced as a result of the project.Asking council to find that written notice of this public hearing has been provided to all property owners, residents and owners of business concerns in the resolution setting this public hearing. City Council requested Dura to undertake this task. Written notice was mailed first class mail to all known property owners, residents and owners of business concerns in the SaintAnthony Urban Redevelopment area. That mailing was undertaken on January 13, 2017, which is at least 30 days prior to this public hearing. Council must find that no more than 120 days have passed since the first public hearing before City Council on this plan amendment.Tonight is the first public hearing before Council on this plan amendment. The statute also requires that two years must elapse before council consider an urban redevelopment plan amendment if they previously failed to approve an Urban Redevelopment Plan amendment for this project.This is the first consideration by City Council of this planned amendment for this project. Also, the plan amendment contains no property that was included in a previously submitted plan amendment that was not approved by City Council. As such, the requirement to wait at least 24 months since any prior public hearing is inapplicable.Must find that the plan amendment is in conformance with the Denver Comprehensive Plan. To that end, on January 18th, 2017, the Denver Planning Board, unanimously, with one abstention, found that the proposed amendment to the St Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan conforms to the Denver Comprehensive Plan and applicable supplements.And a letter to the. To this effect has been submitted as part of the record of this hearing and is requesting that city council concur with the planning boards finding. The St Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan is amended by the proposed amendment will afford maximum opportunity consistent with the sound needs of Denver as a whole for the rehabilitationor redevelopment of the area by private enterprise. The development team of Trail Brake Partners and Copland Company are the developers and private development entities who intend to undertake the redevelopment project. Council must find that the city and county of Denver can adequately, adequately finance and agreements are in place to finance any additional city and county of Denverinfrastructure and services required to serve development within the Sloan's BLOCK three project area for the period during which the incremental sales taxes are paid to the authority. The plan allows for cooperative agreements between the city and borough to address additional infrastructure requirements and city services should they arise.The Urban Renewal Authority has notified Council must find that the Urban Renewal Authority has notified the boards of each other taxing entity whose incremental property tax revenue would be allocated under the Urban Redevelopment Plan, and that an agreement has been negotiated governing the sharing of incremental property tax revenue.This amendment to the Saint Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan invoke certain new statutory requirements. Recall that the original plan was approved in 2013, and now that we are coming forward in 2017, there are provisions of House Bill 15 1348 governing urban renewal activities that now require that City Council before City Council can approve a new urban renewal plan, or in this case, an amendment to an existing plan. You must find that an agreement has been entered into between Doura and the affected taxing districts in regard to the allocation of property tax increment to the project. There are three other property taxing districts.Those being Denver Public Schools. The Urban Drainage and Flood Control District. And the South Sloan's metropolitan districts that I mentioned at the beginning of this presentation. To satisfy these new statutory requirements. Dura has negotiated agreements with these three taxing entities.First, I'll speak to the school funding agreements between Durham and DPS in recognition of the proposed number of residential units expected to be delivered across the entire Saint Anthony Urban redevelopment area, including those blocks which do not have any direct involvement.During negotiating an agreement with Denver Public Schools, which provides that $2.5 million will be paid to DPS over a ten year period to address the impact the Saint Anthony redevelopment will likely have on their ability to provide services to the children in the area.The payment to DPS will be made from incremental property taxes generated from blocks one, two and four and will be paid first before any reimbursement to the BLOCK three project. As the BLOCK three project was part of the original evaluation that DPS made.In looking at the redevelopment of the entire area, they are finding, they being DPS, that there is no additional impact as a result of us bringing forward the BLOCK three project and they have acknowledged the same in an agreement with the Urban Renewal Authority.With urban drainage and flood control. They also were notified of the proposed amendment to the redevelopment plan to add the BLOCK three project. Following that notification, urban drainage evaluated the impact the project would have on their services and determined that the BLOCK three project would have minimal service impacts and have agreed to allow the full available amountof property tax increment generated by their mill levy to be allocated to the project. This again was memorialized in a letter agreement between urban drainage flood control and the Urban Renewal Authority and finally with the loans metropolitan district.At the time, the St Anthony Urban Redevelopment Plan was approved, including the creation of the seven block property tax increment area. Dura and the South Sloan's Lake Metropolitan Districts entered into a cooperation agreement under which Defra agreed to pay over to the Metropolitan District any amount of property tax increment generated by their mill levy.So in closing, Dora is very pleased to be working with the city and the developer to bring forward this project. The redevelopment of this site, the adaptive reuse of an existing historic building, the addition of addition of new retail offerings and a mix of housing options will create a truly mixed use.Mixed income development on this block. This loans block three project advances many of the urban redevelopment plan objectives. And we are asking for your favorable consideration of this amendment and will be I will be happy to answer any questions you may have at the appropriate time.Thank you, Ms.. Huggins. We have two speakers this evening. When I call you names, if you would please come to the front. Cameron. Cameron. Bertrand and Doug. Elements. Cameron. You'll be first, Mr. Burch, on the 3 minutes. Thank you very much.Hi. I am Cameron Bertrand and I live at 1145 Gaylord Street in Denver. I also work for TFG, South Sloan's Lake One LLC, which is the current property owner of the site. So I just wanted to come up and add my support to the passage of adding this project to the urban renewal area, but also as thedeveloper of the St Anthony's site. Just take a moment to say that in some ways this is the culmination of a story that started back in 2013 when the council created the urban renewal area. And I think this is just the kind of project that we hoped would come forward.Historic preservation, environmental remediation, affordable housing, open space. It's a great outcome if you haven't been out to the site in a while. It's changed a lot. There are people living there and people shopping there and people eating there.And I think the variety of housing and neighborhood services that we wanted to see come about through the redevelopment of St Anthony's is really happening. And so in closing, I guess I would just thank everybody on City Council, your staff and in particularly the city and county of Denver staff, especially the public works and in this casealso community planning and development. A project like this doesn't often go off this well this fast. And really three and a half short years, the place has really transformed. And I credit that to the partnership with the city.Finally, I would just like to say thanks to Trail, Brake and Coble, it's always great to work on Denver projects with Denver developers and the Denver Urban Renewal Authority for all their work not only on this project but throughout the city.Anthony site. Thanks. Thanks so much. Available for questions if needed. Thank you, Mr. Bertram. Doug Alliance.Hi. Good evening. My name is Douglas Honowitz and I live at 99, 63 East 29th Avenue in Denver. And I'm here on behalf of Trailer Park Partners and Cable Joint Venture Partnership, known as Sloan's BLOCK three LLC. Catchy name that is the applicant and redevelop her for the purposes of the discussion here this evening in Sloan's BLOCKthree project. I echo what what Cameron was saying there this is tonight is really a culmination of years of work from a lot of people, both in the public and in the private sector, really trying to bring forward a terrific vision.And I appreciate council's consideration of the matter. The project that has been designed and that's being presented tonight is, is is really thoughtfully put together to try to realize some of the items that were contained in the general development plan for the St Anthony's area, in total from the urban redevelopment plan that was put in place backin 2013. And from our understanding of conversations over the years with the community members that were there historically and that have subsequently moved into the area, the vision really is to deliver upon a mixed use, mixed income project that serves the housing needs and the the services for this neighborhood in total from the work of the BoroughCommunity Groups, City Council and OED Jafa, who has been actively involved in it and others tonight we can realize that vision. Restoring an old building and putting it back into use. That's a connection to the past and very important past of St Anthony's here.This is one of those key pieces of the project, the hospital in total that's being saved and reused to continue to serve the community of Denver to mixed housing options for sale for and for rent and restaurant and other other services to the area.We just really think it's going to be a catalytic project that is respectful to the neighborhood boundaries, strengthens the relationship with the park. And we just we're excited to be bringing it forward and very much appreciate your consideration of it tonight and look forward to your support of this measure.Thank you very much. And likewise, I'm happy to answer any questions.Thank you, Mr. Leno. It's all right. This concludes our speakers. Now, are there questions for members of council? All right. Public hearing from counsel Bill 55 is now closed. Comments from his counsel, Councilman Espinosa. Yeah, I just I'm glad that Cameron is here.Doug here with Tracy. I want to thank you, Cameron. I know early in my time in office, we had talks about the balance of this property and what it would be. And there was a question about the life of the Coleman building and what was going to be viable there.And we knew that we needed partnerships. And you established how that could be, but we still needed to find a developer willing to follow through. And when I met Doug and he came forward with this concept for affordable housing, it sort of filled a big it was it was filled a big void that was very much inneed. And so I really I want to thank you for for bringing this forward being and everybody, Doug in our dialog and Tracy for helping see this through because we had good public meetings, we got good output and I mean good input and we're at a place on this development which is which is well, I'm heartened bythis phase three. I'm not going to lie. I wish I wish it wasn't going to beat out the, you know, two blocks that are still sitting there vacant. And I wish we could have sort of built that sort of collaboration and seen those things through, particularly in BLOCK Two, because I thought we we had a good dialogleading up to that. But anyway, I do I probably shouldn't have mentioned that, but I do I do think that there is a nexus for the future and the vision you guys had put forward. And it is missing those two pieces.And I look forward to someday moving forward on that. But in the meantime, I think this is a great proposal and I think the city and the team for persevering and making it happen. So to Doug, Tracy and Cameron, thank you very much.Looking forward to supporting this. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to go back to when these two gentlemen started this project with a lot of community meetings with the Sloan's Lake neighborhood. I attended a number of those at the old St Anthony's Hospital when the building was still there.And to see the progress that's been made in this short time frame and the fact that you're here tonight and there aren't any residents from the community, you know, testifying, says a lot about the important work that you have done with the Sloan's Lake neighborhood over these years.So first, I want to say congratulations and I'm happy to support these bills tonight. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilman Cashman.Thank you, Mr. President. Affordable housing, affordable housing, affordable housing. Thank you for what you're doing.Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Castro and Councilman Lopez.Thank you, Mr. President. I also wanted to extend my support for these for this bill. You know, it's been a long time coming. And, you know, I grew up just south of the hospital. My sister was born at the hospital.Broken nose at the hospital, not at the hospital, but, you know, ended up there. They didn't do a good job, obviously. But I'm pleased to see it develop. I, you know, had a meeting, a good meeting with Dora and Rose Cameron with the development side to really talk about the affordable housing and, you know, the effort thatwas made there. But the need in the future to really think about when we look at affordable housing and look at units that they are not just one bedrooms, that they are two, two and three bedrooms, because that's when we talk about families.Right. We can call one bedrooms, affordable housing anywhere in the city. But when you really look at the need that's out, there's two bedrooms. So when we look at developments, we look at it from look at it with opportunity to create those two bedrooms.So here's the here's the deal on West Colfax. We've seen such a lack of of development and such. And it's been really hard and a lot of hard work with the West. Colfax did kind of pushing that forward.And I think it's about time. It just saddens me that we can't do more. The retail side of this site to really bring that out. You know, I think Councilman Herndon, this is something that you and I have both talked about in the past.But when we look at the edges of this city, we have we are competing with our regional neighbors. They're building Belmar. We're building residential. So it's a it's important for us to be able to keep those Denver dollars and the Denver tax base in Denver and to really support those projects that do that and add a goodquality of residential to the neighborhood. So here's to it moving forward. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Lopez, it has been moves in Sacramento. Secretary Roll Call.Espinosa. Flynn.I.Gilmore. I. Herndon.I.Cashman. I can eat. Lopez. I knew Ortega. Sussman Black. All right. Clark. All right, Mr. President.I police close voting announce the results. 3939 Council Bill 55 has passed. Congratulations. All right, but we are not done.

Andrew pass.Thank you. And we've got the second from Council Member Hines. The required public hearing for Council Bill 175 is open. May we please have the staff report?Certainly, Madam President. Good evening, Council. I'm Brandon Schaefer, senior city planner with CPD presenting an official map amendment application four 4410 North Fillmore Street. The request here is also for an 80 you going from SCADA to view as you see one the subject property is located in Council District nine in the various once used Cisco neighborhood.Here you can see the subject property along one North Fillmore Street between 44th and 45th Avenues. It is a quarter acre and land area, currently a single unit residential structure. Requesting the rezoning from the city that's urban edge single unit de lot size to us you see one which is urban single unit C lot size.That also allows for an urban house and a detached accessory dwelling unit building for the maximum building height of primary structures 30 to 35 feet with a maximum height of 24 feet for an accessory dwelling unit and a minimum size of 3500 square feet.Existing zoning, as I mentioned, is currently, he said. The property is surrounded on three sides by with the zoning as well as you you see it just to the south and east. Land use is single unit residential. Typical for this residential neighborhood as you see a lot of that surrounding along with some two unit residential and publicquasi public uses to the Southwest. The photo on the bottom left identifies the subject property and you can see a mix of the other residential forms that are in the neighborhood, mostly single unit and one, two, one and a half stories in height.Speaking to the process, we sent informational notice of this application in November and went to a planning board in February where it was voted 10 to 0 in favor. And today we have not received any letters or comments from our in-house or the public.Moving to the criteria, the first being consistency with adopted plans. Plan 2040 outlines a number of goals and strategies that are supported by this rezoning related to creating a greater mix of housing options. And offering a mix of housing types and promoting infill development for infrastructure and services are already in place.In Blueprint Denver. The subject property is mapped as part of the urban neighborhood context. These areas do have small multi-unit, residential and mixed use areas, but typically embedded in one and two unit residential areas, usually a regular block pattern and a high degree of walkability.This site is just outside of the half mile radius of the 40th and Colorado commuter rail station. The future. Please type here is a low residential place. These are predominantly single and two unit uses where accessory dwelling units are appropriate and future street types.Both East 44th Avenue and North Street are understated because when we have low residential guidance and we are looking to change the lot, size Blueprint says that it's typically only appropriate to allow for a smaller, lot sized in the existing zoned district if there is an established pattern.And looking at the map on the screen, there is a clear pattern of flats that are between 50 507,000 square feet. As this is moving to the urban neighborhood context, the c lot size is the most appropriate using the lot size analysis for growth areas.This is located in all other areas of the city where we expect 10% of jobs and 20% of housing growth by 2040. And then here again, you can see that additional land use policy and blueprint that encourages a to use in all residential areas and it's a city wide holistic approach is in place.Individual rezonings to enable it to use are appropriate. The neighborhood plan was adopted in 2015 and the future land use concept here is Single-Family Duplex. These are residential areas that are moderately dense with a mix of housing types and the recommended building height is two and a half is consistent with the rezoning request in the neighborhood plan. There are also a number of recommendations and strategies for increasing housing choices and increasing access to housing by allowing a large range of housing types. And more most importantly, for this case, the neighborhood plan speaks to updating the neighborhood context to urban as opposed to urban edge to better reflect the use of the alleys and limiting futurecurb cuts for street access and the continuation of detached sidewalks for possible. The requested rezoning is also consistent with the next two criteria as a result of the uniformity of district regulations and further public health, safety and welfare.By implementing adaptive plans and providing an additional housing unit that can be compatibly integrated into the surrounding neighborhood. This application notes two justifying circumstances, the first being change or change in conditions of I-70, expansion and construction around the National Western Center are noted as change conditions.Also in in thinking through the I-70 expansion, there have been a number of housing units that have been lost in the neighborhood. So allowing for an additional unit here would help correct and stabilize the neighborhood. Also, a city adopted plan serves as a justifying circumstance as this property was resound in 2010, as neighborhood plan was adopted in2015, and Blueprint Denver was adopted in 2019. And both those plans speak to allowing for accessory dwelling units as long as they are competitively degradable to a neighborhood. Lastly, we found this rezoning to be consistent with the neighborhood context, district purpose and intent statements, and those are found in further detail in the staff report.Therefore, CPD recommends approval based on finding or review criteria. Have the Met? I'm happy to answer questions and the applicant and property owner Andrew Garcia is also available. Thank you.All right. Thank you, Brandon, for the staff report. And tonight, counsel has not received any written testimony on Council Bill 21, Dash 0175. And we have one individual signed up to speak this evening and we'll go ahead and get started.And we have Jesse Paris. Okay. We're going to see if we can get. Jesse connected here. It looks like his screen froze. Oh. Are you there, Jesse?The.I know you're your audio's kind of breaking up a little bit. You might need to take your video down.Can I be heard now?Mm hmm. Go ahead.E Yes. That evening members of council. My name is just. There is. I'm represented for a lot of formally for being homeless out loud with all of the changes what are you gonna be party. Oh Colorado in front line black news and I will be the next mayor of Denver in 2023.This rezoning tonight I'm the full support of um. As Councilman Carson has voted who who was telling us tonight we need to increase our housing stock honestly if it's going to be affordable for people that can actually afford it in an area that will rapidly gentrify.Um, this area is literally this site in question is like a block or two away from councilwoman candidacy to block this house. So the neighborhood are very small. They have gone through rapid gentrification as well as the whole northeast of Denver.So. It is a step in the world who are going to occupy this 80 you as a representative of the community on which there are plenty already. So as long as this is not going to be a short term hurdle, I'm in full support of it.Thank you for allowing me to be heard tonight.All right. Thank you, Jesse, for joining us. And that concludes our speakers on Council Bill 171 and questions from members of Council on this one. All right. Councilmember Flynn.Hey, man. President Brandon, could you walk me through or walk all of us again through the reasoning for changing the context from urban edge to urban, it's just this little parcel. Why can it not be stay within the urban edge context and the zone for an aide to you?I'm not quite understanding that because this is an urban context area and context means in relationship to its surroundings.That's a great question. And this is one of those, I guess, separate plants that we don't typically or something that we don't typically see a neighborhood plans. But this was a key recommendation from the 2015 plan as many of the residential areas already have a pattern in this area of detached sidewalks with tree lines and consistent alleyaccess. So in changing the context, that would encourage the use of alleys and prohibit and limit new curb cuts and promote the construction of new detached sidewalks where possible. And then in some cases, I'm not this one. The change in the urban edge to urban eliminates the suburban house building form, so that would make sure that newdevelopment is complementary to the existing character of the neighborhood as well.Thank you. So is it fair to say then that the intent based on blueprint guidance is that at least this area, it's not obviously not all urban edge areas, but this area in particular. Eventually the context would be changed to urban.That's correct. And then the couple of rezonings that I think have come through in this neighborhood since the passing of the neighborhood plan in 2015 simply has been supportive of changing that neighborhood context. Update the actual character that's there today.Okay. Thank you. That explains it. Oh. One other thing. Does it have any effect on the configuration of an ADU on the parcel? Does the change from urban edge to urban bring with it any differences in minimum lot size or setbacks?Or are they relatively the same?They are relatively the same between the urban, urban context and the detached accessory dwelling units form.Okay. All right. Thank you. Thanks, Brandon. Thank you, Madam President.All right. Thank you. Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Sandoval.Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Brandon. So, with the changing of the context, would they be able to split the zone and split this into two parcels and two single family homes and two detached accessory dwelling units?That is correct. The minimum lot, say, is that there is going to is 5500 square feet. And I believe that the subject property is a little bit more than twice that. So that would be an option for them.And is it correct in saying that because this is still excuse zoning, the property owner would have to live on site in order to if they wanted to do a short term rental for the accessory dwelling unit, detached or attached.Yes, you're correct.So one more question before Blueprint Denver. Before we updated Blueprint Denver in 2019, did we have guidance in the former Blueprint Denver 2002 to split zone lots like this through zoning rezonings because I don't remember them coming forward until we adopted the new newer blueprint.Denver, 2018 Was that a recommendation or policy recommendation from the new blueprint?Denver Can you clarify, is it more about is it splitting the lot because Omar Amendment or are you speaking to rezoning to a smaller what size is speaking?Well, when you read zoned to a smaller that size, you're able to do a split. So because it's a it's a smaller minimum requirement, what I'm seeing is this is happening throughout council district nine, in Council District one, often times where you are having developers buy these bigger lots and then rezoning them to X to split thelots and to get two single family houses out of one former prior single family zone lot. So is that a recommendation out of the newer blueprint? Denver Because I don't remember that this happening prior to our update in 2018.Does that make sense?That makes sense now. Thank you for that. So what we do have in Denver and the updated version is we have guidance on what what the appropriate lot size is. And that's where we now conduct a lot, says analysis whenever an applicant is wanting to go to a smaller what size?So in this case, the large size analysis shows us that there's generally a pattern of 6000 square foot lots, and this lot is about twice that size. So if rezoning to a smaller large size, we thought that to see what size is most appropriate to fit that pattern.So in this case that it could result in two single unit residences with two detached aides.Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.All right. Thank you. Councilmember Sandoval. Councilmember. So you hear?Thinks when I'm president. Brandon, can you please just clarify for me then? So it's only in the ESU laws that the owner has to live on the property in order to build the ADA, is that correct?That's the restriction that's been placed on any avenue that's built in the city. Regardless of context. The property owner has either lived in the primary residence or in the accessory dwelling unit.Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks for clarifying. I guess I'm a little bit confused because I thought that that was only for the sue zone lots or the zone lots. But you're the expert, so I will take your word for it.Or I can clarify. Are you speaking more to not the neighborhood context, but just the single unit aspect of the zone? All single unit districts that have any use have that restriction as well.Okay. Got it. Perfect. Thank you so much for clarifying. I really appreciate that.All right. Thank you, Councilmember Sawyer. And seeing no other hands raised, I'm going to give it a moment. All right. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 175. Councilmember CdeBaca.No comments. This is a basic idea in my neighborhood and hopefully you will pass it.Okay. Thank you. Councilmember CdeBaca. Seen no other hands raised for comment. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 175, please.CdeBaca I. Clark.I.Flynn.I.Herndon.I.HINES.All right.Cashman.I.Can I? Ortega. I. Sandoval. I. Sawyer, I. Torres, I. Black eye. Madam President.I. Madam Secretary, closed the voting and announced the results there tonight. 13 I's Council Build 20 1-0175 has passed. Thank you, Brandon, for the staff report and for being here to answer questions for us this evening. We're going to go ahead and move on.Councilmember Herndon, will you please put Council Bill 213 on the floor for final passage?Yes, Madam President, I move that council bill 210213 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. Okay.\nSummary:",

    "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nThank you, Madam President. I have a few outstanding questions and a couple that will reiterate from the safety committee. Is there anybody on the call who can answer questions on this contract?Mm hmm. We have, I believe, Laura Walker and Chief Payton.Got it. We did some digging after safety committee and are concerned about the use of the body cameras and when they will be turning on. And I'm wondering when there will be opportunity, if this is passed tonight for the public and for city council members to weigh in on how the new equipment is utilized and recorded andmade available.All right. Thank you for that question. We'll go ahead and let either Laura or Chief Payson chime in.Councilwoman, thanks for the question. There's a policy that was done with community input on release of body cam footage so the upgraded cameras would follow the same policy.Will you be reopening that policy after this summer's events?We continuously look at policies and procedures for improvement, and we would do that with all policies that dictate performance of officers. What?Can you make a commitment that you will be responsive to? The report out from the Independent Monitor's office in a couple of weeks regarding body cameras and the policies surrounding the Tasers.So I'm sure if tasers are addressed in the monitors report. But we are looking forward to that report we have signed as well as the executive director of Public Safety requesting this. We consider ourselves a learning organization and we look forward to what the monitors report has and what we can improve upon.Great Segway research doesn't really show us that body cams curtail violence and they don't really change officer behavior. And so I'm wondering how DPD is planning to use the body cam footage to identify ingrained police behavior and where training has failed?Well, the purpose of the body cam is about accountability. You can identify the officers performance. Overwhelmingly, the body cam footage not only in Denver but across the country has led to meaningful change, has led to meaningful correcting behavior, as well as holding individuals accountable for their own actions.And that's what we would expect to see moving forward.And Denver doesn't have a good policy, a uniform policy that lets the public know when video footage will be available or released. And so now I'm wondering when we, as the public and members of council can expect such a policy to be crafted by DPD rather than going with a case by case basis decision making that we'vebeen going with.So again, you know, this original policy was crafted with input from the community. There's also additional layers with SB 217 that we are in compliance with and will be in compliance with in the future. We're talking about this camera compared to the last camera.We believe that the policies that are in effect give that level of transparency, particularly with the Office of Independent Monitor, who has access and reviews, body would body worn camera footage on a regular basis.And the transparency is a huge gap that we have here in Denver. And I'm wondering, when you became chief, we were expecting a report detailing when an officer points a firearm at someone. And I imagine that this is data that's captured on the excessive amount of body cam footage that we must have stored somewhere.But no report has been released. And so I'm wondering when the public can expect that data and that report.Great question. And actually a great segway into how we have worked with our community. Pointing a firearm and documenting that as part of comprehensive reporting is how we worked with the Use of Force Committee on or in June of 2020.We amended our policy and have begun collecting that data as we announced at that time frame. And just like we do with all use of force data, again, part of that that use of force, a committee of diverse community members from all across our city helped us craft.We report out on that on or before February 1st of the following year. So all of that data, just like you can go back and look at 2019 data or 2018 data, it is prominently posted. And that was a suggestion from the use of force committee from a committee member that we have followed through with.And I do want to point out that and give credit to our community, because the use of force policy done in conjunction with our community is as strong and as progressive as any in the nation, and it is fully complies with the eight Can't Wait, which includes what you're asking for in the comprehensive reporting.We're definitely past eight. Can't wait as a general public where we're eight to the abolition now. But I am curious about two things. Where in the escalation of force do tasers fit with respect to pepper balls and the tear gas?So again, that policy is online, it's open.You describe it.Is. As far as the use of force policy that is available online, that was designed in conjunction with our community, talks about usage with defensive resistance, active aggression and aggravated active aggression for each.Do we use Tasers first or do we use pepper balls and tear gas first?There is not a used one before another. Our goal in all of this and is clearly stated in the policy manual, not only in the use of force section, but throughout is the goal is verbal de-escalation is to get voluntary compliance before having to use any type of force.The less force used is good for everybody. Would love to get to a position where no force is used. That's good for our community and it's good for our officers.Does every officer read that policy manual?Yes. And we have a a system, an electronic system that requires signoff upon completion.How many pages is it?The use of force policy manual?Yep.I don't have the exact number of pages.So when I download it, it's over 800 pages. And when I've asked different officers about different sections in that policy manual, it doesn't seem. Like it is something that every officer reads from cover to cover. And so beyond the sign off that they've read it, what other kind of quiz or testing is involved to make sure thatthey've read it and know the content within it?So there is the academy that has tests, both quizzes and major tests that are associated with the policy manual. There are all updates are pushed out electronically to indicate adherence and knowledge of the particular policy. Any time something has changed, for example, the changes that were made with regards to your initial question on comprehensive reporting that goesout and each officer or supervisor is required to then read that and then sign off acknowledging that they know and understand the changes.I'm very concerned with just the signoff and not the the content knowledge. That seems to be the priority. I'm wondering also if this contract has any kind of clause in it that does not allow this company to. Transfer over data if it is purchased by another company.How we monitor and protect people's data. We do not allow in our contracts for folks to just to sell data to a third party.That's not exactly what I'm talking about. Say, for example, we collect all of this data. We have a full database of body cam footage, and then one day Palantir buys Axn. They buy the the data service. They buy all of the footage.Even though it belongs to us, they have access to it. I didn't see anything in our contract that would trigger. A renegotiation of the contract if the company is purchased or a termination of the contract.That would be a city attorney question.Is there a city attorney on the line to speak to that?And so, I mean, this is Steve Horn with the Denver City Attorney's Office. And my recollection of reading the contract is, of course, as you mentioned, the data belongs to the city. And as with all of our contracts, we can terminate at any point in time.The language is clear that it belongs, that the data belongs to the city. And so what I think you're describing is a scenario where if Axon were to be acquired by another company in that company attempted to access the city's data, that would be a breach on their part.And we have a commitment from the city not to collaborate and share data with entities like ICE. Correct.I believe that we have an ordinance not to provide certain information concerning citizens in the city. And so I'm not sure if if you're where that intersects with this contract.I want certain verification that this contract, this footage is protected under that ordinance and will not be shared with any outside entities.Councilwoman. That's something I'd need to come back with.Is it? Thank you. Council President. Is it possible to delay this until we have an answer on that?We could most likely delay it to a date certain, if you'd. I know Councilman Hines had his hand up as well. If you'd allow us to get a couple questions, more questions up into the queue, and then we can get back to you as to next steps.Awesome. Sounds good. That's it for my questions. Thank you, Madam President.All right. Very good. Thank you, Councilman Hines.Thank you, Madam President. And thank you, Chief and Sheriff, both for for being here tonight and for doing what is clearly a difficult job in any situation, even more difficult in 2020. So. Hats off to you. I would not want to have your job.So thank you for for being willing to do it. I have received conflicting reports about how tasers are safe. They don't reduce violence on underserved communities like our bipoc neighbors. But there are also a. I get information from constituents that say the data shows that kids, which do not do any of the things that are purported todo, like prevent use of firearms by police or de-escalate police interactions. And so this particular email asks me to tell you to look at data. This particular one also didn't provide any any references to data. So I can't, you know, cite any particular source.But I wonder if if you have any knowledge of data in the police department of how tasers are used, how they reduce violence on underserved communities. I know that's kind of a softball question, but. But here we are.And I got the email today so I wasn't able to provide this to you in advance. So I can tell you that, you know, there have been hundreds of studies on the safety and effectiveness of tasers that has been to you referencing a constituent that reached out to you, saying that their knowledge of of a particular studycounters that without seeing in that report, seeing if at source and if it's peer reviewed, it would be impossible for me to answer that particular question. What I can say is we have documented incidences where Taber Tasers have helped in very dangerous and violent situations of armed individuals that have been able to safely been addressed.And, you know, speaking a body cams, there's a city in Wisconsin that delayed the purchase of body cams and regrets that decision and now is expediting, getting those purchased. There's a city in Pennsylvania, a major city that made the same decision with regards to tasers and unfortunately in the very near time have dealt with a subsequent tragedyas well. So it's important that we have safe tools, that we have strong policy, and that we provide training around that policy to ensure adherence to this. You know, I'd have to point to the hundreds of studies, including independent academic, institutional studies, that point to the safety and effectiveness of that.And you'd have to look at that data or those resources to make an informed decision based on what you read. So. Thank you, Chief. Do you do you have data in the city of Denver? You know, specifically as opposed to studies elsewhere?The city of Denver. Do we have data that shows that there there has been a reduction in lethal force because we have used Tasers in a less than lethal situation. So this is this is not part of the use of force report.And this is an area that we seek to improve upon in the future. We don't have a checkbox. And Taser was used to save a life or in a in a lethal force encounter. We do know based on accommodations or situations where we have been able to help an individual that had a knife and is threatening familymembers where you're able to utilize less lethal tools in order to save individual lives. And again, the goal here is that you have the appropriate tools, the appropriate policy and the appropriate training around it. Thank you, Chief. The and you mentioned that we don't currently have a policy about tasers.I think you have mentioned that our policy document is a living document. It was most recently changed, I think, in perhaps response to some of the protests and speeches 17 that this the new body cameras automatically are automatically triggered when a firearm is on holstered or a taser in a holster.Is that correct? That is correct. That's an available feature that we think is important. With the upgrade in technology. So to that end, that we have this upgraded technology for the body cameras and cameras and supported equipment and software, etc., that would allow police department to more quickly update its document so that as soon as there isa report of a firearm being holstered or a taser being holstered, that could that could immediately trigger some other process. And we have hard data that shows exactly when each of that each of those events happened. Is that is that a fair statement?I yes. Let me just give additional context. So we currently require that report, and now this dataset would be used to cross-reference the reporting of it. So if you know, we had. 36 Taser deployments in 2020. You would then be able to cross-reference the use of force reports that 12 F to say officers completed 36 reports, andthen you would have this data to say 36 times. A taser was removed from a holster. And if it turns out one says 36 and one says 35, we can point to just do a quick cross-reference. And we see that the officer that that hasn't submitted their report, correct?That is correct. We would initiate an investigation, an internal investigation that is then shared with the Office of Independent Monitor or Review. And then I also want to just go backwards for a second. You said something to the effect of we don't currently have a policy for Tasers.It may have just been a slip. We have a very strong policy for Tasers. It's part of the use of force policy, the very strong and progressive use of force policy that was done in conjunction with with input from various community members and community groups.So we could say we have one of, if not the strongest, most progressive use of force policy in the country. Over the next 12 to 17 days, does S.B. 217 change our data retention and release policy regarding body cameras?In some aspects with regards to, you know, the highest levels of use of force. It mandates that that that the DA's office that that those types of situations are released much sooner. And so does does it require body camera footage to be automatically released after a certain period of time, like, I think two weeks, 14 days andbut like that of mine, my misremembering. For certain circumstances. Yes. In. Okay. Are. Okay. I think that's that's fair. Fair for now. I would agree with Councilmember Hastert about his concerns. I mean, this is the public's information and are that the public purchased the body cameras.And so I think there could be a case to be made to have all body camera information available upon request. But we're not talking about that to do so. So thank you for that. Your your response is the last thing that I would say is a mr. Horn over the city attorney's office mentioned that we have wehave we published something regarding. Or rather, we we have a policy regarding publishing information regarding citizens in the city. I think, as members said about his point, was specifically about non-citizens. And so we want to make sure. I do want to ask the question, because you use the phrase citizen and I catch myself often using citizen.So, Mr. Holland, we have a policy regarding releasing information about anyone in this city, citizen or not. Is that is that right? We have a in reference to the immigration ordinance to answer Councilwoman Dukakis question. The city is precluded from use.Any officer employee is precluded from using any city city resources for federal immigration enforcement. In terms of body cameras, the question concerning citizens there is the press sometimes will request. Images or records because they are records under Cora.So it's my understanding that. They could be released under a court request. For citizens or for anyone. For. For the images in general as a record could be released. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.Thank you. Councilman Hines.Councilman Herndon thinking I'm president, just in the spirit of making sure everyone know their roles and responsibility. I just wanted to remind this council that this is a one reading resolution and any council member can delay a resolution for one week without a vote.And if any council member wants to do that, they have that option. Just reminding folks of what our responsibilities are. Thank you, Madam President.Very good. Thank you, Councilman Herndon. We are back up, Councilman CdeBaca. To Councilman Herndon's point. You are more than welcome to delay this for one week by invoking Council Rule 3.7. In order to accomplish that, we would just need to ask the folks who made the motion and second, to withdraw that.If that's your intent.Thank you, Madam President. I would love to delay for a week.Drawing its name.There's no motion or second necessary.Point of order. This rule change does not require withdrawal of the motion. It is under the rule. You just cite the rule. And so I just I think that this this additional step has never before been required and I don't believe is necessary.Sorry for the interruption in order.No worries. I appreciate that we have a motion and a second that put it on the floor for adoption. And so we would just ask that those be withdrawn because it's not on the floor right at this point, that that's the advice I'm getting from our council secretary right now.And so and then we can allow Councilwoman Sade Abarca to invoke 3.7 on withdrawal.Madam President.Thank you. Councilman Hines.Withdraw my ticket.Very good. Again, you can't invoke the rule for a bill that's not on the floor. I think this is with all due.We had moved and put it on the floor. Councilman Flynn had moved that council resolution 20 dash 1356 be adopted.Yes. And it has to be on the floor for the rule to then take effect. If we withdraw the motions, it becomes part of the consent agenda again and the rule can't be invoked. So I think the motions were proper.Sorry, I know this is.I think accomplishing we're accomplishing the same intent. And that was the direction that I had been given. Either way, we have that motion pulled back and we have a vote. 3.7 will double check on that, but there's no motion or second to invoke that.And so I'm getting the thumbs up from everybody on that. And so if we're all right, we'll go ahead and move on to the next item on the agenda council. Woman Say to Barca, you still have your hand up.Was there an additional question that you had or comment?No, ma'am. Just waiting in queue. Thank you.Okay. Very good. Very good. The next item up is Council Bill 1320. Councilmember CdeBaca, please go ahead with your questions on Council Bill 1320.Thank you, Madam President. And I actually got my questions answered on this one, so I don't have any questions on this one.All right. Very good. The next item up is Council Bill 1390. Council member State Abarca. Go ahead with your questions on Bill 1390, please.Thank you, Madam President. I am curious about a couple of pieces that are in this change and that were presented to us. There is a piece that allows the executive director of Human Services the ability to adopt rules and guidelines for this tax.And I wanted to know what is the plan to engage the public, either on the front end or after the rules are changed so that we're aware of what happens under this new power? Good evening. Thank you so much for the question, Councilman CdeBaca.My name is Krystal Porter. I am the program manager for the Ideas Program at DHS, which brought forth these ordinance revisions. And so I'm happy to answer your question about that. Our plan is to engage stakeholders prior to pursuing any rules and to follow the public rulemaking process that's outlined in the ordinance in the DRC.So we would plan to have some kind of stakeholder meetings that we've already had some thoughts and conversations that have been put forward to us from community members and stakeholders as part of some of the advisory groups that our our program engages.And we are looking forward to continuing those conversations. We didn't want to run before we had the ability to do so. So we haven't fully mapped out what that engagement process will look like. But we do plan for there to be several opportunities for people to weigh in.Thank you, Ms.. Porter. And if there's a stakeholder group or a committee set up, can you make sure that our officers get notice of that so that we can have somebody present? I'm also curious about a piece of the PowerPoint that had mentioned a community housing report, and I'm wondering what exists already to tell us a littlebit about how our dollars are spent on housing under ideas. So under ideas, we have not pursued a lot of housing initiatives to date. We've worked through our advisory council at DHS to learn from them. What they wanted to see with that initial recommendation from a community needs assessment completed in 2018, what we have done is alreadyinvested dollars in housing stabilization efforts ramped that up quite a bit this year in response to COVID 19. So we're already in that space in different ways, but now we want to look at some opportunities to really change the landscape for housing.Opportunity for people with A.D.D. in this housing report will give us a level of detail specific to Denver that we don't have at this point. That'll be awesome. Can you tell me a little bit about classification? And if you require individuals to already have their I.D. classification when they come to you for services, or do you guysdo any eligibility or classification services themselves? That is a great question. So the the what the classification or what we call eligibility determinations done through the community center board serving Denver. It's part of the state program administering funds for Medicaid waivers and and supports for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.And so they often go through that process. What our ordinance does allow is it creates space for people that have an intellectual developmental disability but may not have been identified, or it may have at some point left the system and may have themselves experienced homelessness or been shuffled around and want to return back.So we do have the ability, if people have not received that designation before and need to be evaluated, our funds are still able to provide some resources and support to them as they pursue that eligibility. And do we do any of the outreach for that classification service in shelters or the jails?That would be a question that I could take back to the community center board partner that we work with, Rocky Mountain Human Services. I know they do some pretty extensive outreach. We also are looking for opportunities to do presentations and meet with different partners to learn how we can better educate people that are accessing these services fromdifferent points. And so if you have some ideas, we would love to meet with you further on that and we can certainly circle back with you on information about what's already happening through our partner with Rocky Mountain Human Services.Absolutely. I've done federal compliance for people with disabilities and find that a lot of people don't actually get the right classification or don't have a classification at all, especially in our jails and shelters, and want to make sure that that is one of the indirect costs that could be included.I'm also wondering if legal services for individuals with ADR are included in the indirect costs that this now allows us more flexibility to spend on. Um, Councilwoman CdeBaca, could you clarify which part? When you're discussing indirect costs, you're talking about indirect costs for our service providers through their contracts with us.Yes. Okay. Thank you. So. So, actually, the kind of services that you're describing would still be considered a direct service. So if we were providing legal services and sports for people with intellectual developmental disabilities, we would engage that service directly.It's a it's a direct labor cost. So the indirect costs that that cap refers to are meant to capture other costs that are necessary to running a business and having good infrastructure to actually deliver those direct programs. And so with your also, since you did clarify that, it's primarily about administrative and overhead costs.I'm wondering if you guys have a gold standard for the percentage split in the nonprofit world that they try to keep overhead to 5% or less. And so I'm wondering if we have set any thresholds or gold standards for us.That's a really great question. I would love to refer you to a memo that Denver Human Services worked on in response to questions kind of of a similar nature from Councilman Flynn at our November 18th safety housing presentation.I can speak briefly to it, though. What they're finding and really what actually the standard recommendation is moving forward is that and how the federal government actually does this with their agreements is to work with partners to understand their costs and to classify those costs so that no, they can actually take a realistic look at what's neededto be able to have a good impact and a good outcome for the people that are on the receiving end of that service. And in fact, there is the possibility that the the rate that you're describing is actually a rate that is insufficient to support the operating needs of an organization, particularly for organizations that are smaller andcan't spread that that indirect cost around to various funding sources or projects. Awesome. How will the public get information about that? Because I'm less worried about the small organizations doing a million different things. I'm more concerned about our big boys on campus who, you know, have.Six figure salaries for their executives and the workers are getting $30,000 a year. I don't want to I don't want the city to be paying for those executive salaries. Now, that is a really great question. I mean, currently, the way that we've we've engaged that thus far is twofold.Certainly, people can see the contracts that we execute and can request those from the clerk in recorder's office. And so they have access to the various rates that we've negotiated with our partners. I mean, additionally, we do a lot of our reporting out on how our programs and services are operating through our advisory council based on questionsthat they've asked and information that they're interested in receiving. For our biggest player, in particular, the Rocky Mountain Human Services contract. They also come and do an annual report to City Council on the services provided and talk about the various aspects of those services and programs.And so I think we have multiple areas where there is the ability for light to be shed on those activities. But if you have some other ideas on how we can be as transparent as possible, that is absolutely our goal with this program and we look forward to hearing that from you.Awesome. And do we collect audited financials from our partners prior to releasing dollars to them either through grants or contracts? That is a great question. I would have to defer to Lori Noble, who is our financial services director, and she's on the call to kind of talk about our general practice with that.Thank you. And that's my last question. So when she answers that, that's it for me, Madam President.All right. Great. Thank you, Councilwoman. Go ahead, Lori.Hello. Thank you so much, Councilwoman, for your question. Yes, we actually do, as part of our risk assessment, understand what kinds of areas need to be looked at. And part of that risk assessment that is performed by our internal audit function and group is to look at any kind of audit reports that have come out for RockyMountain and other contractors. Awesome. Thank you very much.All right. Great. Thank you. Next up, we have Councilman Hines.Thank you, Madam President. I guess I'm going to. I think, Ms.. Porter, maybe you could answer this. How is the how is the contract with Rocky Mountain Human Services going? I think they took over on July 1st, right when they the fiscal year rolled over to the new fiscal year.All right.So, Councilman Hines, I think you're referring to the state contract for single entry point services for Medicaid waivers that are for that that can be accessed by people with ID, but are actually covering a wide span of other areas of service, including mental, mental health, mental illness, things like that.So talking about Human Services has, I believe, for over 25 years been serving Denver as the community centered boarding has been over the the Medicaid waivers that are specific for people with intellectual developmental disabilities. But to answer your question, from what I what I've seen and heard so far, I think it's going well.For the Heidi, 25 year history.Sorry. I know I was referring to your question about the recent transition. We do still follow kind of the general updates and activities about that, especially because there are a lot of people with ADT that may have opted to receive services through this other waiver, other waivers that are available to them.And so that transition has gone, I think, pretty well, pretty smoothly so far. And we look forward to hearing more from Rocky Mountain human sources about that.I would be happy to provide feedback about that too. I am on the sci fi through my flight, but that's not a waiver and thank you for pointing it out that that is not part of what we're discussing tonight.So, Madam President, thank you. I'm done.Thank you. Councilman Hines. Councilman Ortega.Get a muted here. Thank you, Madam President.So I wanted to ask Christo. You're the DHS point person. Right.So we do in a three year contract.Just out.Of curiosity.Yeah, I think that's a really great question. We in the past have done longer contracts with IHS. The contract that most recently ended was also a three year contract, and there are some really great opportunities there to ensure that there is some continuity in services.A lot of the services the military is supporting are services that people are accessing day in and day out. And so as much as possible, it just kind of helps us with our planning process and we still have the opportunity, you know, should an appropriation change from what we believe it could be in future based on whatwe believe revenues would be coming in from this council, then we have the opportunity to go in and amend the agreement. Same if there are any other issues that may come up over time. So the three year the three year agreement is is based on annual terms and performance and negotiating kind of a new budget for thenext year. And so even though it's a three year agreement overall, it's segmented out pretty clearly into these individual terms that allows us to kind of evaluate services as we're going. So a number of years ago, it was agreed that.DHS would be holding back a percentage of.The dollars and allocating them.Yourselves, as opposed to the entirety of it.All being administered.By.Rocky Mountain Human Services. Because the history had been that although they could be contracting out.Some of those dollars, that wasn't really happening in real practice. So I guess I want to know a couple of things. How, what's what's the amount.Each year that's being held back?And is that being accrued with other dollars that haven't been allocated? Or are you guys allocating the full amount each year? And then as part of that, one of the provisions that I didn't agree with is that Rocky Mountain could also apply for the same amount that DHS was holding.Back and trying to reallocate to.Other providers in the community. And I haven't seen any data showing whether or.Not they are.Applying and getting some of that funding or whether it's actually going to other providers. So can you speak to some of that?Certainly I'd be happy to to answer those, and I'll try to kind of track through your question. It's been a lot of questions. Yeah. So firstly, when we look at how we're allocating our funds, we actually aren't basing it on a set percentage.We're not saying, you know, 75, 85, 95% go to Rocky Mountain Human Services. We're meeting with them and working with them and listening to what's happening to services at the state level and listening to what needs are elevated to us through our various stakeholder engagement and community conversations, so that we're actually funding services that are really pivotalto people's lives and wellbeing. And so we don't hold ourselves to a set amount because we want to be responsive to the need. And what is there, I will say of our for our agreement this year, it was a $15 million agreement for 2020.Over $3 million of that was contracted out to providers of various sizes through our Rocky Mountain services for initiatives and projects separate from the community center board that does not include services that are contracted in the day to day as part of our Mill Levy Service Plan program, which basically means if someone is only has it intheir service plan to be able to access the program four days a week, the bill of funds can fund that fifth day if if there's a need for that, and so that those funds then go out through contract to those providers that are providing that service for that individual and is based on that individual's selection of thatprovider. Currently, any funds that are not being spent are through our mutual agreement are either contracted through. We have about five partners, I believe right now, five active partners that are not Rocky Mountain Human Services, that are doing great work in the community.And we're really looking to seek out several more partners in the next year. That's part of what we're hoping to accomplish with some of these ordinance changes, is to create space for those providers because we recognize that there's going to be a lot more diversity than the direct assistance that we provide through Rocky Mountain.So will you clarify.If that's just US dollars you're.Talking about, or is that a combination of the dollars that they contract out.As well as the DHS dollars?So that's the DHS dollars. Okay. Rocky Mount Human Services contracts with over I would say last year in their 2019 report, they reported 103 community provider agencies. So completely separate of that, we've got five we're working with, one of which is Rocky Mountain Human Services.We have several more on deck. We're working through those various contracts and projects to get them established. And and we're looking forward to bringing at least two of those to you guys in the near future.So it would be helpful to get a list of all of those community provider agencies that Rocky Mountain contracts with. I know that what were the discussions we had some time ago was around trying to meet the needs of individual clients.That are currently under.The Rocky.Mountains.Purview, if you will. And, you know, it's it's a lengthy and complex process that people have to follow to get in, to be able to access services. You've got to be on the wait list, you know, all of that stuff.And so I'm just curious to know how that's going in terms of whether individuals ability to get more services now has been expanded as the amount of money has increased since. I mean, COVID has had a huge impact on it.But when I.Came on in 2011, we were at somewhere in the ballpark.Of about 11 to $12 million a year, and now it's way in excess of that. And so I guess I'm just curious whether we're getting more people in the pipeline and and their services or being met. I know we can do some services.While they're on or awaiting.Getting on the waitlist. But I just looking at the PowerPoint, which I have in front of me that you all presented to the the committee, I can't tell whether or not we're giving more services to individuals or whether we've gotten more people into the pipeline that need them.And again, it would be helpful to know kind of where are we on the waitlist as well?Absolutely. That's something that we connect with Rocky Mountain on fairly frequently. And I would love to set up a follow up with you and possibly share. Happy to do that. Little more. Yeah. Okay.Thank you. I have no further questions. I think.You know, this is a program.That Cathy Reynolds actually was the catalyst in, in moving forward by creating this special mill levy for the developmentally disabled community in Denver. And over time, it has. Since the inception, it's been the same entity doing this. And I know that they have to be approved through the state, but it it almost also violates our executive orderthat tries to put these things out to be it on a regular basis. And when it started, all of the different providers in our community were getting a share of these dollars to serve their their clients.And now it's kind of like the Rocky Mountain is is the sole entity that.You know, that is our community service provider through sort of approved by the state. But at the same time, some of those others have tried to gain access to the resources and some have been successful. Others have not been as successful.And so the access continues to be an ongoing.Concern and making sure that you all are tracking that. And I know that's part of why.You hold those extra dollars aside to ensure that the needs are.Being met in our community.So it would be helpful to have that.Follow up with you, to.Just understand a little bit more detail, kind of where are we with the waitlist and where are we in in terms of spreading those dollars further?Or are we putting more.Dollars into each individual that's already in the you know, in the system?Thank you. Certainly. And if it's okay, Madam President, I'd love to just create a couple of points of clarity there. I think you're right in the sense that we've worked with this energy for a really long time, and there have been times where that hasn't gone as well as I'm going right now.What I will say, though, is that they are because of their state designation and the role that they played in the community, they are kind of this nucleus for services in Denver and it is challenging and not really necessarily our intention to create different entry points for services when we have a population that is especially vulnerable andmay have difficulty navigating a more complex system. So I would love to have more conversation with you about that. I think we've done a lot to try to diversify our provider network, and we're looking forward to doing more of that.And one of the things I would love to point all council members to, since this deadline is coming up, we actually have one of our new partners, Point B strategies is working with organizations on the smaller side to work with them on projects up to $10,000.And that application window is open until December 4th, which is Friday. And hopefully you you all are able to push that out quickly without.Cumbersome contracting.Nightmare. We do our best well following what's necessary to adhere to our contracting process, but I hear that feedback. Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you. Madam President.Thank you. I have no further.Questions or comments.All right. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Ah, and thank you, Crystal, as well. Our next item up is Council Bill 1271.

We have nothing called out. Under pending. We have nothing called out. Madam Secretary, please pull up the first item. 191. Councilman Flynn, we put resolution one on the floor.When? 91 on the.Floor. Sure, Mr. President. I move that council resolution 18 dash 191 be adopted.All right. It has been moved and seconded comments by members of council. Councilman Flynn.Mr. President, I ask that this be called out for a vote because I wanted to vote no on it. I understand the terms of the lease. It seems that we're paying less per square foot than we did for the last sublease we did with the Denver Post over at 101 West Colfax.But when I reviewed the agenda over the weekend, again, I just couldn't I just couldn't vote yes to pay $9 million plus to to the parent company of The Denver Post after they laid off 30 journalists in this town, one third of their staff.And it's just. Mr. President, just something I couldn't I couldn't do. So I wanted to have it out for a separate vote. Thank you.All right. Thank you. Councilman Flynn, any other comments by members of Council Councilman Ortega?Thank you, Mr. President. So one of the the important things that I have requested is to see an overall. Real estate master plan. And what I learned from our real estate office is that every agency has their own real estate plan.But somebody has to have that comprehensive look in where we go with as a city in looking at future needs. You know, we own a property that was purchased by the city that we ended up not utilizing that could have been used for office space over in southwest Denver.It would be far cheaper to renovate that and utilize that facility than to be utilizing the Denver Post building where we already have two floors of that building. Some of the more expensive real estate. We don't have to have every agency concentrated downtown.We have a variety of agencies that have historically been scattered across the city. You know, we have our Rosslyn office out in northeast Denver. We have our wastewater department in southwest Denver. You know, this is part of how our city has functioned.And I just think it doesn't make sense to be spending this much money for downtown real estate when we own property elsewhere. So I will be voting no tonight on this as well.All right. Thank you, Councilman Ortega, Councilman Lopez.Thank you, Mr. President. I think Councilman Flynn. There's some solidarity on that when I'm. I'll be voting.No as well, too. Yeah. All right. Any other comments from members of council? Got questions on this or this? Okay. You didn't log in, but Councilman Nu, you got a question for real?I think you called me.Yeah. Real estate. Yeah.Is someone here from Lisa?Good evening. Lisa Lemley, Division of Real Estate.Lisa, thank you.Can you go over some of the.Costs associated with this.That we've commented on and how.Long is.This agreement this sublease?I am going to apologize because the term I did not bring with me, i believe it goes through 2028, which is consistent with The Denver Post. So these are Subleases from The Denver Post. So we stay within that.It's to give us the expansion and contraction ability right now that we need with the overflow that we have in Webb. I can't address that. Actually, the building that Councilwoman Ortega is mentioning, we have been looking at some other internal city uses that we may be utilizing that building for what has made the Denver Post building aworthwhile one to have the discussion for. Is that it? Especially this ninth floor? We need to be clear. The Denver Post was not on this floor. It was another tenant. And Denver Post had the lease with the other tenant.The tenant was downsizing. We stepped in, which is why the lease rate is also less than the other sublet release that we have in place. And it was just backfilling their space, so we were not moving any Denver Post agency employees out of that floor.But it does allow us to have efficiencies with the agencies that are already in the building, the technology that is already in the building, and the proximity to web not for our employees so much as for other clients or public that comes that needs to go sometimes between a couple of different agencies.And what is the cost per square foot for?For this one, it's $28.20.And for.Me and you know, in.The DAMION dollars, you know, it's about.$350.A square foot that we could use to build a facility. Sound like for that kind of money you could you could possibly build a are used to renovate another space would more cheaply or do you think is.Well I think time well I don't know that we could do it any that's a hard one to answer because we're comparing different things. What I would say is timing is an issue for us though, as we've had the new fees for the last few years that have continued to increase up around 250 is a year.Where we've got about you owed about 13,000.Employees.Permanent in.Temporary.Positions. And so I think.Councilwoman.Ortega brought up a good point. We need to plan out the total real estate.I mean, there's this is a very large workforce, a.Huge employer base.And so it would be nice to know how we're going to be able to manage the office.Space and work.And we could sit with you. Absolutely. As Councilwoman Ortega referenced, and I believe I mentioned it at one of the a previous city council meeting, we do look, especially for our major agencies, we look at the master planning efforts so that we understand how they are growing, what their business function is, so we can prepare for that. Within that, then we take it and apply it as well as some of the other plans, the overall looking at the overall portfolio of the city. So we are looking down the road at a three and five year plan.And if we did not approve this tonight, what would the impact would that be on?It would be very significant in terms of some other moves that are there's it's almost a domino effect for us to be able to address some of the other issues that we're trying to find space for within web so that we can bring those and allow those hires to happen.Yeah.Thank very much. Thank you. Yeah, just piggyback on that. Can you name the agency that's to be moved to for.The ninth floor? It's Parks.Okay. So this would is it fair to say that it would impact our new employee, FTE, that we have hired for 2018?It would as it impacts the ones that have not been able to be hired yet. Got it. That's the key.Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. So we have 30 to 50 FTE coming to Parks.I don't have those numbers in front of me. I'm sorry. I can certainly confirm that for you tomorrow.That would just be huge increase over what I know. So that's. That's. That would be worth knowing. The. Yeah. Yeah, no, that was Councilman President Brooks. That was the question I had. So thank you very much. Yeah. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa.All right. Seen? No, Dr. Sussman.That reminded me of a question. Thank you, Mr. President. Isn't the plan also to include the number of employees that we may be hiring with the bond project? That we are expecting quite a number of new fees. And and even the council has requested there be even extra employees for things like traffic and transportation.Thank you, Councilwoman. Yes, this includes when we look at this overall plan again for Webb, for the expansion that would go into the Denver Post, building other locations as well. It takes in the approved of TS. That also includes our Bond team that will be coming on and growing as the projects grow, as well as other consultants. So other agencies, tech services, one also hire consultants that are not in that FTE number that we work for. So this.Is part of a planning correct face that you all are doing for the city and for office.Use. Yes.Thank you.Okay. Just comments from Councilman Espinosa. Yeah. I think at some point I'm going to want to sort of understanding I mean, since for three years we've been asking for that real estate master plan and some sort of long me and wide, wide scope vision of of of real estate and space and and space planning and all thisstuff. We keep doing this incremental thing. Bonds are not new weeds. We just got out of the ten year bond. Somehow we did it. We went through a recession and cut down FTE. So without, you know. So I would like to understand how many square footage did we how many square feet did we get rid of whenwe went through a downturn? And how much of that have we captured and how much more have we gone past that? Because are we now getting too big for our britches and unhealthily sort of large as a as an organization?And I know we approve that budget every year, but that has been a lingering question. And we are going through the budget process right now. Do we have space for any additional FTE? Yes, because if this is always a component to every time we add, because we always talk about the all the sort of wraparound costs associatedwith FTE, if we don't actually have the space and we're going to end up in other contracts at very high dollar amounts at peak market while we're acquiring acres and acres and acres and square footage out at the Western Center and other places in-we we sit on vacant properties in District three and in District seven, it's justand we sell land in District one. It's just I need some really clear explanation on this. All right. I'm going to just make a couple comments. Number one, I think Councilman Ortega's request is justified. We do not have to think about a master plan of what we're doing for the next 5 to 10 years.It's tough because we're we may be entering into a recession. And I remember in 2011, Web was empty, you know, and and now it's not because we are responding to the demand of the city. I think I stand in solidarity with Kevin Flynn and Councilman Flynn.And I think a lot of folks who are hearing about what's going on with The Denver Post, they hear that, you know, and immediately react. Unfortunately, we have the issue of responding to a budget that we just approved and to constituents who are demanding for more services.And so if we stop those services because of this issue, I think it's going to I think it's going to come back on us. And so I'll be voting in favor of this with all of those issues. But I would ask that we would take a three, five, seven year look and start thinking about our real estateplans around around the city. This is expensive. This is very expensive. But at the same time, we did approve this for our budget. Madam Secretary.Raquel Ortega. No. Sussman, I black. CLARK All.Right.Espinosa No.Flynn Now.Gilmore. Herndon.High.Cashman.No.Can each on. Lopez. No new. Mr. President.I. Please call the voting or announce a results.You have certainly ten on the board.We're missing two dozen.Mm hmm. Sorry.Okay. Constable, when anyone passes seven five.

Recommendation to adopt a resolution authorizing the city manager to execute a contract with Westnet for the purchase and installation of equipment to upgrade the fire station alerting system without advertising for bids in an amount not to exceed $215,326 and increase appropriations in the Capital Projects Fund in the fire department by $215,326citywide. This item requires two votes.Mr. West.Yes? Administrative Bureau Chief for the fire department, David Honey will give a brief report. Good evening, Vice Mayor Lowenthal. Members of the city council, the first in a learning system, was installed in the fire communication center and all fire stations in 2003.The system is the interface between the fire communication center and the fire stations and gives first responders of the fire department information detailed information about emergency calls in each response. Most stations are still using the original technology from the 2003 installation date, and since then, WESTNET has made available to its clients significant upgrades.And much like using older computer equipment that advances quickly. We're now using 12 year old technology and have the opportunity to upgrade that. The purchase also includes a request to purchase turn out timers, which would give.First responders a visual readout of the time elapsed since the call came in. And what that does is allows the.Firefighters to to meet response time goals.And get out of the station.Quicker and responding to the incident.

A secondary of the motion is up and there we go. Councilmember Granger.I'm glad to see that the fire department is on top of this. It's obviously a big issue for the community when you're talking about response times, and I hope that this new piece of equipment really works for them.Thank you.Councilwoman Mongo.While I appreciate that it's time to upgrade. They haven't been upgraded since 2002 and ten years has gone by. I hope that when we're put into these situations with sole source agreements as councilmember prices motion brought before our Council several weeks ago stated, we really need to do.It would be helpful if there were additional options in terms of knowing had we been with a competitive company and what that upgrade cost would look like, because we obviously don't have any alternatives because we're in this position.But in spending almost a quarter of $1,000,000, it's important to know how far deep into this hole and how many how long it'll be until the next upgrade. So that if we do need to make $1,000,000, multimillion dollar transition out and we'll know what options we have, because I know all this is the premier system and I'mproud to have it here in Long Beach and L.A. County uses the same system. There are alternatives, and I want to make sure that our upgrade costs are not exceeding that of our neighbors.Councilman Andrews.Yes, I also would like to tackle that. But the biggest part about it, I think when we talk about this type of money and public safety, I don't think that there's anything we should ever want to turn around looking back on.We definitely want to upgrade anything we need.

And what I got for you is a two part staff report where we will I will tell you a little bit about why we're here with the creation ordinance for the Five Points Business Improvement District, as well as a quickPowerPoint presentation showing the location and some of the other things that are going on with the proposed district. The city has been petitioned by a commercial property, by the commercial property owners to create the Five Points Business Improvement District.The main purpose of the Five Points Business Improvement District is to improve the economic vitality and overall commercial appeal of property within the district. The district will extend 11 blocks along both sides of Welton Avenue from 20th Street to Downing, including parcels adjacent to Welton on the southeast corner of 26th and Washington and parcels and the southeastside of California. Between 26 and 27, the district will encompass 219 properties. The district will provide programing and benefits to business and commercial properties located within the proposed boundaries that will include economic development, physical improvements, safety and advocacy.The site consists of approximately 42 acres and is located entirely within the city and county of Denver. The district will be a Title 31, Article 25, Part 12 Business Improvement District, and will be utilized to assist in the acquisition, design, funding and construction of certain public improvements authorized by the Business Improvement District Act, including, but not limitedto street lights, decorative structures, statuary fountains, identification signs and bicycle paths. And in and adjacent to the site. The district will also be utilized to provide services within its service area, including, but not limited to a consulting with respect to planning and managing development activities within the service area of the district.B Promotion and or marketing of district activities. C Organization promotion, marketing and management of public events. The activities and support of business, recruitment, management and development and e security for businesses and public areas located within the district as.Determined by the board of directors of the district. The aforementioned services are collectively referred to as district services. The services, facilities and improvements to be provided by the district are not intended to duplicate or supplant the services, facilities and improvements provided by the city and county of Denver within the proposed district boundaries.The district is being created to provide enhanced and otherwise unavailable services and improvements within its boundaries as part of the creation process. Office of Economic Development provided a grant approved in 2015 for the petitioners to begin a feasibility study in late 2015 and met with the and met with surveyed and met and surveyed people in the fivepoints neighborhood of the required of the 50% required total assessed property represented approximately 62.3 of the petitioners were in support and 50% of the. And then there's another statutory requirement that 50% of the acreage must also be in favor of this.And they attained 56.7 of the petitioners support for these two thresholds. The district initial budget is expected to be $162,000 to fund district ongoing administration and provision of district services. The initial revenue will consist of property tax revenue on commercial real property and a transfer of the remaining funds from the Wellston Corridor Pedestrian Mall Local Maintenance District. The district will impose a levy of ten mills and only commercial real property in the district boundaries. The district will not assess any mills on any personal property. Residential property is not subject to the revenue raising powers of the district unless the property owner changes its use to be commercial.The district shall exist in an initial term of ten years at the end of the initial term. The district will dissolve unless the district board determines the district has been successful. The board will then request the City Council to renew the district by resolution at the conclusion of that initial term.Also before you today was the dissolution ordinance for the Welton Corridor Pedestrian Mall. This is a local maintenance district that is currently on the mall or on the corridor and is being dissolved. If this bid is created and moves forward, in addition, it is submitted that there is an operating plan for the Five Points Business Improvement Districtthat meets the requirements of the Business Improvement District Act and further meets applicable requirements of the Colorado Constitution and other laws. It is further submitted that the types of services and improvements to be provided by the proposed district are those services and improvements which best satisfy satisfy the purposes of Part 12 of Article 25 of Title 31, Colorado Revised Statutes, as required by Section 31, 25, 1277, subsection five of the statutes. It is further submitted that the formation of the Five Points Business Improvement District has a demonstrated all public purpose and that it will support the implementation of neighborhood and economic development goals.The Office of Economic Development is supportive of the district creation. Approval of this operating plan does not approve any specific development plan or change in zoning. City Council approval of the bid creation allows for a proposed district election, including the imposition of an assessment to go forward to the November 2016 ballot.The Board shall consist of five electors of the district appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the City Council resolution. The initial members of the board are proposed as follows Dr. Renee Cousins, King Paul Books, John Patricof, Nathan, Bill and Carl Bert Burgess.Supporters of the bid are present today and available to speak on behalf of the district. City staff recommends approval of this ordinance.Thank you. All right.We have Tracy Winchester is going to finish with this report.Thank you, Andrew. My name is Tracy Winchester. I'm the executive director of the Five Points Business District, and I live at 217 South Jackson Street, Denver, Colorado. Thank you, Mr. President, and all the city council members for having me here today.When I was in front of the Business Development Committee, I had 21 slides and did it in 5 minutes. Today I only have 15 slides, so I'll do it in 3 minutes. So I just wanted to let you know that what happened here and there we go.We go this way. What happened here on the Walton Street corridor did not happen organically. What happened in 2009 was the community got together and decided they wanted to revitalize the area and they selected overarching goals through studies that they did with their strategic planning group.They had professional urban planners come and help them develop a vision for the area. Their overarching goals were a business development, historic preservation, tourism, land use, parking, transportation and sustainability for an urban green corridor. So the road map, this is just a laundry list here of what we did step by step with regards to working with theOffice of Economic Development and helping to fund our office and helping us to go after the grants that we received from the federal government as well as the state of Colorado with regards to coming together and figuring out what the vision is for the neighborhood.And the future of Denver is bright, is shining, is a shining star. We have over $300 million worth of construction and development that's going to be happening over the next 24 months. And you'll be seeing those developments because we became a tough district in 2012 by the approval of city council.And again today, you'll have a project that you'll see later on after my presentation. But this is just an example of what's going on with regards to development with the rezoning and as the crown jewel. Now in our proposed business development area, our business improvement area, we're looking at 219 parcels, of which only 88 are commercial, 42commercial property owners, over 700,000 square feet of commercial property, 42 acres with an assessed total value of over $15 million. Ha ha. Here is the map between basically 20th and, well, ten to 30th in Downey with just a little bit of jutting out on the sides there on Washington Street, which includes our historic district.All these parcels begin at the north side of 20th Street, going northeast along Welton Street, terminating at Downing Street and 30th Avenue. The parcel located adjacent to Welton Street on the southeast corner at Washington Street and 26th Avenue, is included as part of the district.What do we do for community outreach? Well, we did quite a bit. We started in November with our consultants PUMA, the Progressive Urban Management Associates. And before we even had the consultants, we had a steering committee. We have five community meetings, 21 one on one meetings for property owners and businesses just to do a feasibility study todetermine whether or not this is something that is that can be achieved on the Welton corridor. And then we also did surveys as well to be more detailed. We started November 17th with the property owners meeting. We sent out letters in December trying to set up individual meetings.We had our January newsletter, which went out to the community that had over 1300 people on our database. We also again had meetings with property owners throughout January and February, again to determine the feasibility of this. We were featured twice in Neighborhood Life February issue as well as in the May issue with regards to talking about ourquest for developing a business improvement district. We met in front of Curtis Park Neighborhood Group. We met again in front of our community meeting groups as well as we had a petition campaign drive kick off on March. It was originally March 31st, but because of March Madness and a snowstorm, we had to change it to April 12th. And then, of course, newsletters some more. And then again, we had a positive result because on May six we were able to send in to the city and county clerk the record of petitions that represented 56.68% of the land and 62.3% of the total assessed value.We had been very successful. We more than met the threshold for achieving and creating a business improvement district. As Andrew mentioned in his staff report, the wall to Street Maintenance District as it exists today, which is assessed roughly about $55,000 in 2016, is only two blocks.And so once this is actually passed and once they are voted upon, once this is voted upon in November, this wall to maintenance district will dissolve and become part of the Business Improvement District. All dollars that are associated with the maintenance district will come over to the bid.But it will only be used for that two block area. Thus, our budget that we talked about, although we're only going to raise about $157,000 on an annual year with a ten mill levy, about $5,000, we figure it's going to come over transfer over from the Walton Maintenance District.Initially, we have ten years is our term. We decided that we didn't want people to feel locked in, that even though we had the ability to be infinite, we did not. We wanted to have the group who was in charge ten years from now be able to go back to the community, to the property artists and decideif this is the right way to go. As Angie talked about, our five board members, some of you may know the name Carl Bourgeois, the owner of the rezoning, and he is also on the board of directors. Again, the operating plan is all about enhanced maintenance, physical improvements, economic development, safety and security, marketing, promotion, and still advocatingfor the five points area today in 2016. And hopefully it will be still there in 2026. Thank you so much for your time.Thank you, Tracy. Thank, Andrew. I believe we have nine speakers. I'm going to call up the first five. You can make your way up to the front pew. We have Rick KRON, Tracy Winchester, Catherine wallace, the sheila sayer and medalist stigler.Apologies for any mispronunciation. So if I can go ahead and make your way up to the front pew and Rick, you can go ahead and begin your remarks.Evening. My name's Rick Crone. I'm an attorney at Spencer Fein here in Denver. I'm working with the organizers in favor of the proposal. I'm just here to answer questions.Nick, thank you. Thank you. Speaker Tracey Winchester.And that was just a mistake. I've already spent my time thinking.Next. Catherine Wallace.Yes.Good evening. My name is Catherine Wallace. I'm a business owner on the Walton corridor. I've been in business for over 50 years. I my property is inherited through my parents. I am opposed to the b i d simply because of the structure of the corridor.There are more vacant properties on that business corridor as well as parking lots. I do not see a vision of businesses coming in from 20 years to 23rd. Also, there is a block of city buildings which will not contribute to the b i d.I am curt. I have been involved with the Walton Maintenance District for at least 25 years and have been paying those property assessments as well. And a 10% levy in addition to my regular property tax is unacceptable to me and I cannot see any improvements coming in because when the infrastructure was done or the feasibility was donefor the Walton Street maintenance, we really didn't have what it takes to in order to really put that Walton Street maintenance district in. And I believe it's going to be the same as now. We're having problems right now with lighting and with the watering system.And there are a host of other problems initiated through this Walton Street corridor. And I have been I have seen this go through process after process, neighborhood revitalization. That was in the late seventies. Then came the Welton Street pedestrian mall that's been in exist for 25 years, supposed to have new improvements, only got trash cans and nowthe bad. And then I don't know what the real cost is going to be in the long run. Thank you for your consideration and thank you for listening to me.Thank you, Miss Wallace La Sheila Sayer.Good evening. I'm Lucida Sayer. Say I'm a business owner adjacent to the Welton Street Corridor. I'm in support of replacing the existing Walton maintenance tax and expanding the coverage area to the proposed 11 block segment there on Welton Street.And I'm in support of the Business Improvement District five points.Thank you. Next, Mandela Ziggler. And as she's coming up, I'm gonna call the last four Maude. Maude Brown, Lofton, Myron Melnick, Will Austin and Paul Brooks.Yes, my name is Mandela Steiger. We've been in business for over 50 years. Franklin Steiger broke down in Barbershop and I suppose to be the due to the fact that some of the things that Katharine was saying. What I don't understand is why should the respondents, you know, they be getting the same service as the business.So there's more residents in the 3000 blocks of wealth and 30th and down and on 20th, there is property properties. There is. She was saying we kind of had the same thing written down, belong to the city. So I suppose I'm not.Thank you. Maude Brown Lofton.Good evening. My address is 47 Tamora Drive.Littleton, Colorado, and I stand.To speak in support of the business.District. I think it is a fantastic way.For business owners to be invested and engaged.In supporting the.Development of.The.Entire measured.Section of the Belt and Street Corridor. I think it will also aid.Residents who live there by generating money for improvements.By which they will benefit from.I think it's a great way for a very historic area of the city to be on par with other areas in.Other districts in the city, and.I stand in support of it.Thank you. Myron Melnick.Mr. President, can you remind the speakers to, I guess, either say their address or their affiliation?She did say their name. And if you're comfortable doing so, your home address.My name is Myron Melnick, 3001 Welton Street. Mr. President, council members, thank you for this opportunity to speak with you. I bought my building at 3001 Welton in 1996. It was three and a half walls and half a roof.And I spoke with economic development about the feasibility of getting this project off the ground. They told me to knock it down and build a metal building. I didn't listen to them. I wanted to preserve the 1895 building with the beautiful mural on the side.And I was able to do that. I installed sidewalks, gardens, sprinkler systems. I put a lot of money into that building. There have been I've seen five points. We've been waiting for the rationing for the last 20 years.We've been waiting we've we've heard all kinds of things about improvements to five points. The light rail at the time. They've closed the station across from my building. It just everything they've done. But now with the city booming, there's big large projects going in with hundreds of residents.On my particular block, the 3000 block, I am the only commercial building on that block. I don't want to be taxed to take care of the rest of the residents. I feel we all have to share in it if that's what we're going to do.I don't think this is a fair thing. I was not I was not given the petition or any information about this. I was not notified. I worked closely with the Five Points Business Association since I've been there. I donated chairs for their conference table years ago.I've donated art. I paid the money. I had a good relationship with them. When it comes to raising my taxes, they don't call me. I did not sign any petition. I knew nothing about it until about four weeks ago.So I am against this. I feel like there's too many rundown buildings. There's too much development that needs to be done. The free market will handle this. And when it's built up and we have a good a good business district, that'll be the time to add the improvements.Thank you.Thank you. Mr. Manning will often.Mr. President, members of council. Good evening. My name is Will Alston. I reside in that great neighborhood of Park Hill and I am the previous executive director for the Five Points Business District, and I'm currently a board member.I came here tonight because I wanted to to remind folks that, you know, I had the privilege of shepherding the vision plan that this council approved. And in that vision plan, we talked about the need for an entity that would work, would play a lot of the role that the Five Points Business District is playing now.And in that role, I believe it is this business improvement district. We we brought in back then the folks at home to help us look at what all the different models on. Again, if you revisit that document, you'll see all the different options that that that we would have had.But we actually put that in there because we knew at some point we needed to create an entity that would be self-sustaining. And in my mind, and we believe that's the vibe, that's the, the, the business improvement district.And so I come here tonight to just ask you all for your support on this, because, again, it wasn't something that just came out of the blue. We thought carefully about it when we were developing the vision plan and we incorporated it in that document.And so we're here now to kind of realize what that vision was and that this business improvement district is. It's what.We believe.Is the next evolution of moving five points forward. Thank you.Thank you, Paul Brooks.Good evening, President and council members. Thank you very much. My name is Paul Books with Palisade Partners, which is a property owner and I'm also part of the Five Points Business District Board. I also had the privilege of being the chair of this committee to explore the business approved districts that we have and that we have infront of the council tonight. My story with the Five Points area begins in 2013, and I had no idea stepping into this this great neighborhood, how much work and effort had gone into getting the Five Points neighborhood to where it was in 2013.And a lot of the effort has to do with the effort that Wilson and Tracy Winchester had done up to that point. We had as well mentioned the neighborhood vision plan was in place. The urban renewal area had been approved for the area and plus it had been designated a cultural, historic district.These things and more created a platform with which the neighborhood was able to spring from. And then also on top of that with the Office of Economic Development providing the welcome challenge also as a spring spring board. I think that this business improvement district, if approved, will create the next base, the base of the future and createa viable and exciting commercial corridor. So I encourage a support tonight to help us with this next vital step. Thank you.Thank you, Mr. Brooks. That concludes our speakers. Now, time questions. Any questions from members of council and Councilman Brooks?Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. Tracy Winchester, can you come up real quick for a question, Tracy? Just a couple questions. You know, a little bit Rapidfire of, you know, why didn't we? There's a couple concerns come up. Why aren't residents involved?Why are we not taxing residents? We looked at a general improvement district and just love to get a short snippet of why we didn't go that direction.Definitely it was on the recommendation of our consultant Puma that said that although we wanted to have a general improvement district as well as a business improvement district, similar to what Rhino did with overlaying the two areas that because of the feasibility study, the results of that study with interviewing people and talking to residents, it didn't seemlike this was something that was going to pass. It didn't seem like the residents were ready to have a guide. In addition to IBRD, they understood that a bid makes sense because it's going to bring traffic, foot traffic in and visibility for the businesses that are there now on the corridor and those businesses to come.But the idea just wasn't the right time, as well as the fact that we didn't have a specific infrastructure project that we could really tie in to. At the same time, that was on the advice of the city that said, you really need to have something in place from the city government saying that this is what isgoing to happen for your area, that the residents can rally around and see specific benefits happening for them.Great. And there was another concern saying that, you know, this business improvement district is not going to bring any improvement to Welton. Can you talk about a little about in the budget that you're building out for the bid, what are the improvements that you're looking at?You know, the specific improvements, whether it be marketing, whether it be snow removal or the be all those issues, lighting.Right. The top three services that we want to provide under the Business Improvement District is safety and security. We want to be able to have private patrol, which is something that other business districts surrounding us, such as Lower Downtown Denver Downtown Partnership, as well as 16th Street Mall as well as Colfax, are looking into having some privatesecurity to make sure that we supplement what the police are doing. Now, the other thing that we definitely see is maintenance. I mean, this is something that's a responsibility, as you know, of all businesses need to take care of the exterior of their businesses so we can collectively come together and create a nice uniform, look a beautificationof the corridor that we can collectively do together. That again, is a benefit and it's cost efficiencies. The other most of the people who are in the Welton Maintenance District right now, they're assessed fees are going to go down as opposed to it going up.So it's really in their best interest to be able to have a bid because the economies of scale allow us to get more money for more, but more. What is it for you? But for my board, that's it.And then the third is marketing and promotion. Again, we want to talk about what we're doing on the corridor and we want to be able to bring businesses and more residents to come to the quarter. And we need to do that with a collective marketing and promotion, which we will be able to do.Okay, great. Thank you. Andrew. Real quick question for you. You know, couple of residents are fearful that if we approve this tonight, it's a done deal. But just talk about the process that they do get another bite at the apple.There is going to be election in November, things like that.Correct. So tonight what we're looking at is the creation ordinance and the ordinance in front of you today just simply creates the organization called the Business Improvement District. There's also other organizational aspects of the budget and whatnot, but they will this is a preliminary budget.They will also be bringing that budget back in the fall when they have a newer or a better handle on all the costs and what the local maintenance district moneys will be transferred. And then you are correct, the they won't have the ability to actually raise revenue through taxes until the November 2016 election, in which case therewill be a vote of all the eligible electors in this commercial district that will have the opportunity to vote yes or no on whether or not to raise taxes up to ten mills.Great. Thank you. That same bank.Accounts and works. Councilman Espinosa.Tracy. So when you do these videos, you do them a lot like council and count votes, you know? And so that's probably what you mean by polling. Do you have a map that basically shows where the support is and isn't in the bid so that some somebody like myself can understand what where that support lies and doesn't? You know, we did not do that. We didn't overlay the petitioners who signed and overlaid it on the map. We can do that. But I didn't have that prepared for today.Okay.But I can get that.But that and then the just so the public knows that that percentage comes from land area. Correct.Right. Has to be to formulas that has to be met. It has to be with the value of the land, which is that right now, 62%. And then also the actual mass of the land that it represents or acreage.So 56% of our property owners who represent 56% of the land, the acreage signed the petition and the value is represented by 62%.Okay. Then I have thank you. I have one question for actually both Katherine Wells and Paul Books, and it's the same question. So can I have you both come up? Katherine, did you say you had 50? This is not for both, actually.Did you say you were there in a business for 50 years?Yes, sir. My mom and dad bought that property in 1956 and created wireless beauty Nook, and we have been there most of the duration of that time. My dad did own a property on on Walnut, and he had a bar and restaurant there and we rented out the property.Then we came back in the late seventies and renovated, and we've been there ever since.So the question for both of you is my experience with With Five Points only goes back 30 years. But in that 30 years there's been I've seen program after program and investment after investment, not unlike what you were talking about.So I would like to know both. Why didn't what you're in your opinion, why didn't they work or why didn't they do whatever they set out to do? And what makes this different? So.Well, first of all, there's.Always been a nonprofit organization over the. Over at the projects. The board members that were put in place normally were not really property owners. They were you might have one property owner on the board and the other people representing that did not pay any taxes.But yet we're making all of the decisions. And as you know, the five point Business Association misrepresented our our our fund, and they didn't get anything done. So it's been a problem of the board people and the fact that the city has not encouraged the property owners themselves to come forth and work with them, but rather wealways have a third party. And you know, when somebody else is spending your money is easy. Yes, that's real good. When our money is being spent and we're not having the representation, then I don't think that that's really good.And so didn't have they. Have you communicated that? And is there an attempt to address that? Maybe that's a question I'll ask Tracy to follow up on that. Did do you know.I've only communicated with Tracey one time in 2016. It was a one on one meeting and it was held on April the 20th, and that didn't go too well. And so therefore the communication was not very good.Okay. Thank you. Paul essentially the same thing. I don't know how long your history is with Denver, but I'm sure purchasing into that area. You're so familiar with how much investment we've done essentially since Welton. I mean, Wellington Webb was in office, so we made that an area priority through multiple projects and multiple investments and and microloansor whatever. So what makes this different?Like you said, my history only goes. We moved to Denver in 2006 and have really been involved in the Welton Corridor since 2013. But I guess I've had the exact opposite experience. I actually did do the do real estate program at the time.I actually volunteered under Will Austin when they were first starting the Five Points Business District Improvement District, and at the time they were spending a lot of time mapping out who all the property owners were so they could start getting all of them into the same room and actually start having the right conversations.And so I think I think that's where the success really stemmed from, is starting to do the neighborhood visioning plan and make sure that I mean, they have a board that they actually had all these neighbors that were part of it actually signed this visioning plan and really say that they're a part of it.So they they really got community buy in. And then my my other experience has been is the Welton Corridor in general through the landmark process and through some of these other processes is forced great interaction among the citizens and developers and what they want.And and it has started to result in, I think, some, some great outcomes and actually could be looked at as somewhat of a blueprint for for Denver as a whole. But so I so I guess my, the short of it is, is I think and I don't know if they didn't do this in the past, but theyreally did unify the neighborhood. They got people in the same room talking and having the hard discussions. And we set together over the vision plan. And then on top of that, they implemented, like I said, the urban renewal area, also the cultural historic district, and then have continued to implement that plan.And again, my experience with Tracy has been that she's you know, we we went through the list every time we sat down to try to make sure we met with every single person and try to reach out and contact as many of the people, if not all of them as possible.So, again, that that that's been my experience through this process. And I think I think they've done they deserve a lot of credit for for what's come throughout the last six or seven years.I'm going to paraphrase what I just heard so that so that I can make a point of it. Yeah, I believe I just heard a developer say that landmark and other processes which are regulation regulatory force to great outcomes and now you're up here telling us to tax you more.I just wanted to go on record with observing that.I've had a great experience with one corridor and the landmark process I think has made our buildings better. Yeah, and it's, it's also I feel like I have a great relationship with many of the residents through the multiple meetings that we've been through.So I'm going to go I maybe this is putting words in your mouth, but does it is it because both design review and the bid you give you as a developer more predictability about what is the future of that place?When I first came into it, it was the only cultural, historic district, and there was there was no guidelines. What that meant. How do you how do you do a design review for a cultural, historic district? And we're actually in the process right now of of the landmark is putting together specific guidelines for this neighborhood.And so I think that will provide more predictability. We were kind of the guinea pig through the process. And I think a lot of the design guidelines for Landmark have stemmed from the multiple meetings. And and then and then Landmark has taken their own process as well with multiple public meetings.But yes, I think in the long run it will provide predictability. But what I also think it does is and I think it's a good standard anyway, is it does it has encouraged interaction and people listening to each other.And and so I, I think, you know, density in general is, has been successful there because they're they felt heard and they they they like the outcomes of what ends up with the building. So.Okay. All right. Thank you. And actually, Tracy, I think that that makes it pretty clear to me.About just what do they have a low point of clarification on when Ms.. Wells was talking about the Business Fiveways Business Association mismanagement of funds? It wasn't this organization was a previous organization. So we have never had any mismanagement of funds.Yeah. And that's what, that's that clarity that I got, which is that in, in the we those other measures that we've been putting in historically were sort of in these vacuums. And that was a place that that probably needed stronger leadership than it had, you know, more orchestrated manner, a little discombobulated in how things got metered outover time. And so, yeah, with a regulating guideline of the cultural district and, and guidelines and standards coming forward and all this other stuff. I do think it all helps to know that when that when a commitment like this is made by the.The commercial property owners that there will be some expectation of performance from the bid. And I'm glad that you put a ten year cap on it. So thank you.Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Ortega.Thank you. Tracy, I have two questions for you. The first one is for both existing as well as new residential projects that have commercial. How how will they be handled? Is it only the commercial part of those buildings that will be included?Well, I actually had a map that I took out of this presentation that really showed there's about three different types of commercial properties that will be included. Mixed use will definitely be included. But we will only assess the part that is retail and commercial.So if it's a 60,000 square foot building and only 4000 or 5000 on the first floor is retail, that will only be assessed on that 4500 square foot of retail. Vacant lots are considered commercial, are in fills and then also totally all commercial and industrial is also considered commercial properties.So any of the tiff. Projects. Those are handled the same if they have commercial in the buildings.Yes. It should be included. I mean. I mean, that's the way I see it. Yeah, sure. Please.Councilwoman, one of the real keys here as far as business improvement districts and what's commercial and residential is that's a determination made by the county, by the assessor. So it's not done by the district. It's a city person that does that determination.They'll need to be in agreement with the district. We have not got that together yet. We did get a very similar agreement in Reno, though, and I would expect to have the same thing here as far as how that's going to work.Okay. So that's the main thing. So, yes, those mixed use business buildings, residential, according to the assessor, will be assessed at the residential rate. Will not be included in this assessment. Commercial would be.Okay, great. Thank you for the question.Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. The questions 341 Scene nine public hearing is now closed. Time for comments, Councilman Brooks.Thank you, Mr. President. Two 2011, July 18th. If you would have told me and I think I said this, a business improvement district, if you said this is a business improvement district, it's late. I said, if you would have told me that in 2012, we'd have an urban renewal area and in 2013 we would start to getour first development. In 2016, we would have a business improvement district with over $300 million of redevelopment planned. I would have said, What street are you talking about? Are you talking about Brighton? Are you talking about Colfax? Are you talking about all the other streets in this city?It is. This is an incredible feat in the last five years to happen here. And a lot of the credit started with will Austin be in here? My main man who can sing, if he didn't know he can sing because everything starts with a vision and he brought the community together and got the vision behind it.A lot of people talk about, well, you just had a great economy. Yes, that was very helpful. But you need a vision and then you need people to right the ship to live out and dream out that vision.And so that's what we've had. And Tracy's been great at implementing that vision and it's been incredible. A lot of a lot of kudos goes to Puma for helping us walk through this process as well. And also Paul Bucks for, you know, being the chair of it, because a lot of folks don't understand that in five pointsin on wilderness, hand-to-hand combat, you know that what we heard tonight has been conversations that we have had over and over and over again. And your comments tonight don't fall on deaf ears. We really respect your comments and we want to continue to work with you.And, you know, if you don't see the growth that's happened on Walton, let's walk and talk about it and let's see the growth that you want to see on Walton. This is one of the things I'm most excited about in our district.The transformation that's happening in this district is incredible. I see OSD in the room splattered in the room here and Sylvia's been incredible. And Paul Washington. And I just want to say that the return on investment of what already has done has been incredible.And we're seeing it. And so I told I was telling one of my colleagues that the the unspoken word here in this whole conversation is gentrification. Are you all experiencing gentrification? And of course, we are. But the difference here, and I think you see it, is that there is a community of diverse leaders here.There is a majority of African-American ownership here on Walton. And you're going to hear a little bit tonight. There's over. Just about 280 affordable housing units on deck, and you won't be able to tell the difference on what's affordable and what's high end.And so we're really excited about that, where we're trying to bring that balance. And I think the Business Improvement District will keep us on par with what is happening in Reno, what is happening in LoDo, what is happening in ballpark, what is happening in Arapahoe Square.So, Mr. President, I am excited to support this and just thank you everyone for your hard work to get this done.Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Councilman Espinosa.Yeah. I will be supporting this. But I did want to speak to the opposition that these are these are always close votes. Just because it's a property rights obligation thing. And what I would suggest to you is that, you know, the boundaries, you go out and you start polling those neighbors.I mean, you start doing your your legwork because sorry, Tracy. Tracy is doing the same thing. And you go out and you try to get support for your your point of view, because I think that's leverage. I think you want to have this $155,000 a year bigger than our council budgets.Each one of these of us. And and because you have expectations, they haven't been met historically. So you want to be able to have your seat at the table. They're willing to have you at the table, but gives you some some leverage.If you go out and you start asking for people's votes in that area to help you leverage your position with with other owners. So I just that that's the legwork that you have to do between now and November.But I hope I don't think I think Tracy and Paul would probably be welcome, you guys, to the table. I hope so. Because the in the end, if it goes through, you're all going to be obligated and all have to be working together anyway.So do it from that point, which is we're just trying to make sure we have a strong representation and voice as a as a group. It sounds like everyone's open to that. Just make sure, because you guys have historical knowledge, Paul has new knowledge.And that's the future of of of Five Points is a blend of the two. So make make it happen. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Any other comments? 341. Scene on Madam Secretary. Roll call not black eye.Brooks Yes.Clark, i Espinosa. I Flynn. I Gilmore.

Correct me if I'm wrong here, Mr. West, but we are going to hear from Mr. Goodling, who will be making the presentation.Mr. Goodling.Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Mr. West. Good evening. On behalf of the Long Beach Convention Visitors Bureau and our 400 members. Thanks for taking the time tonight so that we could share with you an update on what's been happening within tourism.The this past year has been a record year. If we can get this slides up here. Okay. So this past year, as I mentioned, has been our best year yet in the history of the Long Beach Tourism convention visitor.We had over $2 million in the top. For a total of $28 million. And over a six year period, that's been 130% increase in total. So it's gone from 12.4 million to 28 million. Interestingly enough, this is the fourth largest tax revenue generator for the city of Long Beach.So behind property taxes and behind also sales tax. This is the fourth largest tax revenue generator for the city. Every dollar invested has returned over $6. And in doing so, it's been a very competitive field for us to play in.We have sales representatives in major cities, north in San Francisco, Midwest, Chicago, North Atlantic, also two in the D.C. area and one down in Atlanta. In addition, we have half the sales team based in Long Beach. That is also backed up by a convention service team who services the customers when they're here, and also a marketing teamthat helps to provide the marketing materials not only for conventions, but also for other tourism and pleasure travel. Our sales team attended 28 tradeshows, basically one every other every other week this past year. In addition, we've had over 122 site inspections.That's basically two clients. And these aren't just individual clients. Often they come with several people. So 122 site inspections looking at the city of Long Beach. The great news is, is when we get them into the city is when we have a high closure rate once they see it.What we always hear is, gee, I didn't know changed, but we hear one of the two. The other thing that separates us from our competition is when we bring site inspections in. We create a community event. These are two clients out of Atlanta, and we either do a breakfast or a community luncheon.We had a client recently say that in 30 years of doing this, she's never had any other city in the U.S. pull together a committee of people that she'd be working with to greet her and actually have a meal.And that left an indelible impression. And because of that, they get to meet our working committee, our team, the team they'll be working with. As I was talking with a few a few people lately, as you all know, by this point, we're very much relationship driven, not transactional driven.Many cities today are transactional driven. They get a lead. They disseminate it to their hotels. They don't actually act as an ombudsman between the client or the hotel. We actually serve as both navigating through it. Several years ago, we had the privilege of hosting TEDx.And with that, we learned several things from TEDx. There is a recent article today that was just published on how decisions on choosing a destination for a convention have changed. Back in the eighties and nineties, people chose destinations primarily based upon ancillary activities.A lot of people used the convention as an extension of their vacation time. And what's transpired since then is people are using conventions now for more for networking and learning job skill sets to make them more competitive, either for their company, organization or within their industry as a whole.Ted epitomized this new generation of meetings at the TED conference. They had seating throughout the throughout their entire campus. The whole idea was if you saw somebody that you wanted to talk to, you could grab that moment instantaneously, sit and have a conversation.Think of the last time you were back in a convention center not in Long Beach. You had to walk down a long corridor, sometimes to the food court. Sometimes you found maybe a long metal bench. And that was where your conversation had to take place.We don't believe in that. We believe in the TEDx style. We believe in creating an environment that encourages you to network with your colleagues. And in doing so, we have transformed the Long Beach Convention Center into being a facility that basically has been designed to encourage networking.So throughout our campus we have a variety and I love this shot. This is a gentleman that at Twitch Con and regardless of where you want to hang in, in the convention center, there are seating everywhere. And in addition, the arena has been a wonderful boon for us because it's created it, yet at 40,000 square feet, anadditional meeting space. And it can be used for General Sessions. It can be used for special events. But it's multi-use. It can also be used as an arena. Since transforming this space in 2013. Its days in use has gone from 154 days a year to 258 days a year.It's practically booked all the time. The other thing that we learned from Ted is you not only do create this great environment to network, but you have to have a wow party at night. You have to have something that really sets you apart.And it has to be something that you feel. If you're vibrancy, it feels great. And so the Arena was the first party that Ted did, and that was where we got the inspiration for this new project. In addition, they used the underpass under Seaside Way and they brought in food trucks, they brought in picnic tables and theybrought in crystal chandeliers and hung them under and created a. Southern California food truck party. Well, as Ted has moved on, the other phenomenon that has occurred is Instagram. You can't go to a party now without someone wanting to take a photo.The great news about these Instagram moments is if they're provocative enough, if they're cool enough. Not only does it market your city, i.e., Long Beach, but it also markets the association and it markets it to their colleagues and friends saying, Gee, you should be here, too.So what has been created at this campus is a turnkey facility that lets national associations which have limited budgets. They don't have budgets like Google and Facebook and others, but their budgets nonetheless now can be used for food and beverage while we add the rest to create those instagrammable moments.So with that last July, we opened up the cove and we like to thank Councilwoman Janine Parrish for the help on the lighting in there. It's become a very safe area to walk. A boon for our residents, but also a boon for our conventioneers.And I'd like to share with you in the past 12 months how this special space has been used.I can't believe.This is history.It's a party now.Everything's turnkey.It's just very creative.You know, there's so many opportunities to do phenomenal things with your event here. Long Beach is definitely one of the most innovated convention centers that I've worked in across the country.So what was a sleepy underpass? And quite honestly, foreboding at nighttime has now become an active, vibrant space. And last year, the Port of Long Beach was host to the National Association of Ports. And Mario introduced me to a lady from Puerto Rico, and she told me that she'd been coming for 25 years to these conventions.But she thought that their Long Beach convention was the best yet. They had used the arena and they had also used the cove two great spaces. In addition, Mayor Garcia came up with a request, which of course we love his request because it's always fun.And this one was Steve. Let's let's take care of the fountains out front. And the fountains were 40 years old, and they really needed help. And so with that, again, Councilwoman Jeanine helped as well. And we got there and Charlie Byrne from the Convention Center and I worked on this project and we now have our third turnkeyspace complete with trusses, outdoor stage lighting and all of you got to experience that at the inauguration in July. But we'd like to share with you what Medallia and other companies have used this space. But again, think of Instagrammable moments, think of cool parties, think of other cities.And I will share with you there is no other city like Long Beach. At nighttime when you walk around the fountains, it's beautiful. We were out there recently. There was a father with his two kids. It was 10:00 at night.It was. It was during the summer. And and they were just having a blast. And, you know, it's really a fun environment and it's a great, great spot with that. We also have our challenges ahead of us. And a couple of us have had conversations about what those challenges are.The as we've moved forward and we moved ahead of the pack, quite honestly, in the private sector, there is a there is a group called Gaylord Hotels, and they call them Convention Center Hotels. They're large hotels. They have an average of 1200 to 2, basically 3000 rooms.They have about the same footprint as the same size of our convention center. And Marriott Corporation bought them a few years ago. And they're growing them quickly. They're opening one in the Rockies. There's currently one in Washington, D.C. there one is open in Texas and of course, Nashville, which was the founding one of the Opryland.This for a meeting planner is almost a dream come true because you sign one convention and Gaylord Hotels usually try to sell three years consecutively. So you sell one convention under the same contract language and you do it for three years, so you get a three year run.And so we've had to compete with that. In Long Beach, for example, when you book Long Beach, you have a convention center contract, you have various hotel contracts anywhere from 4 to 10 on average. And so we really have to oversell on how we're so different.And we are different. And what makes us different is what we just went through our turnkey spaces and our great seating, but they are catching up to us. And one of the things and these are just a couple shots, of course, down in Opryland.And then the new Texan resort. So in essence, if you put a little roof over downtown Long Beach, that's what we're competing with, in essence. And in addition, our regional competition, Sacramento, is asking their city council for 360 million to redo their civic center, basically their convention center.They want $30 million to add a 40,000 square foot arena. Our adaptive reuse program for the Pacific Ballroom was only 10 million. And so we've taken our assets. We utilize them, given them birth in new fashions. Unfortunately, we've not had to bond or go after significant moneys to do what Sacramento is doing.But this will become a competitor as it's finished. In addition, Portland is adding a new hotel, Hyatt Hotel, right next to their convention center. For those of you who have been to Portland, you'll know there's not much to do around the convention center because they don't have a lot of hotel inventory.Now they're starting to grow. And so for us, we have the Gaylord, the the large box projects. We have large hotels in San Diego, Anaheim and L.A. that we're competing with that are 800 to 1200 rooms in size.And so for us, we need to continue to invest in the building. We've strategically taken the position we've invested in the exterior or the customer feeling of the building. We've, fortunately, have been ahead of the curve with that.Thank you to city management. Thank you to the mayor. Thank you to all of you for supporting that. And now we need to take care of the behind the house. It's a 1960s building. We have a lot of work that needs to be done on infrastructure.And so with that, we have to address that. And we've had those conversations. And, of course, we look forward to the leadership as we move forward into resolving those issues. We also have the Olympics coming up in 28, and that's less than ten years away.All of you have been involved in commercial projects. It really takes a good two years to get things up and running, which means then you have six years, six, seven years left to make sure you bring them under completion.So the time is now to do what we need to do at that facility. These are some of the renderings that you've seen in the past. It's going to be wonderful. Long Beach will be home to the world.And so it's going to be a great time for us to showcase our city in addition to progressive leadership. Four years ago. And Julia Wang came and said, Steve, we have this great idea. It's called Powwow. I reached out to the mayor.The mayor loved it. We reached out to city management Peyton Tom. They loved it. We reached out to the port and the port got on board. And before we knew it, we had the support of bringing pow wow to Long Beach.The artists that were here this past year, they personally and individually had contracts with Prada, Tiffany, Nike, Adidas and others, and they were here.It forgot DC Comics.And DC Comics. And go Superman. And so with that, we we've had the best artist in our city. And with that, these are the murals that they have left behind. This year alone, four pow wow. We had over 128 million in print and also digital press advertising equivalency, close to $1,000,000 in power alone this year.And we brought 43 press in just for powwow. The fun thing is, I think Pat West calls this the best urban renewal program going. $2.7 million is the aggregate valuation of 73 murals in four years. So in addition to all the publicity, in addition to creating a lot of recognition for the city and bringing people in, it'salso left. That left us a legacy that's continuing to last at this time. I'd like to have Lauren Simpson share with you. Other things that we've done to bring pleasure travel into the city in addition to our convention travel.Lauren.Hello. So this year we continued our partnership with the aquarium and the Queen Mary on a co-op at in Sunset and West Ways Magazine for a combined circulation of 15 million. Instead of purchasing ads separately, we partnered together, which allowed us to have this two page spread in front of you both being highly visible versus each ofus going in individually and having smaller ads. Furthermore, we've driven as we've driven leisure travel. It's been an incredible year in terms of exposure for the city of Long Beach. This past year, we've hosted several media visits, including a group visit of 38 four world renowned artists.I'm sorry, journalist and digital travel. Sorry, let me come down. 38 group visits, including digital influencers and writers from around the world. We hosted 26 individual media visits, which included, again, digital influencers, writers as well as editors from around the nation.Now, as are sales. Just like our sales team. Excuse me, our team relies on relationship building because of relationships and our proven commitment to service. Once again, we've had the chance to host the Latino bloggers. Now, these bloggers had a choice of hanging out with YouTube, Mazda and Neutrogena to name a few.But we had 80 who decided to hang out in Long Beach. Now that 80 represents about a fourth of the attendees for that conference. Here's a recap video of their experience here in Long Beach. As you can see, I've had a great time hanging out with those here in the city of Long Beach in their first year. The conference had an opening and sponsorship and the CVB stepped in to help them out and host a group. Well, now in their third year, Long Beach is chosen over top brands like a YouTube to hang out for their attendees.So we're doing something right. All of these efforts culminated into many amazing placements for us throughout the year. This one right behind you or in front of you was one placed in the New York Times. This one singular story had a circulation of 1.8 million.Now, just to backtrack a little bit, it took we pitched this outlet for over two years. The writer finally came out and hung out in our city. Had such a fantastic time that he wrote an incredible story. Again, one article equal a 1.1 circulation.And now to total it all out. For the past year we've had a total of 246 million in circulation. And this past year, we had an ad equivalency of 1.9 million. Our two overall impressions on print were 281,000 broadcast, 332 and again, 205 million impressions online.That includes both influencers. So social media posts, blog posts and online journalists. In terms of social media, we've seen double digit growth in our followership. As you can see, Facebook is nearing 50,000. We have over 20,000 on Twitter and Instagram is nearing 20,000.Now, keep in mind, all of our followers are organic. We've not paid for any of them. Aside from that, a lot of them consist of travel writers, digital influencers and editors who taught our city shared stories online or in print, and then continue to share their Long Beach experiences and throwback Thursday posts.We've had some great movement in terms of social and wanted to update our website. We had a soft launch, and something that's great about this new website is its way of harnessing social media. So on it you'll see tons of user generated content and great video.Another key component is that is the use of virtual reality and 362 hours. Once you launch the VR, you'll notice that there are blue waypoints towards the top, singling out hotels. Our website, I'm sorry, our Long Beach Airport.Major attractions as well as our convention center. The Tories also feature an interactive video component. We offer experiences like driving in a drift car where the user is able to put on their headsets, see everything that's in front of them, but then also see everything behind them.So as you know, when the drift cars go, all the smoke that flies up, all you have to do is turn your mouse or turn your headset, and you can see all of that happening behind you. Now, this is something that keeps us ahead of the competition.Especially since we know that today's consumer is all about the experience. With our new website we're right on target so have fun exploring. Visit Long Beach dot com. As you can see, we've had an incredible year in terms of exposure to the city of Long Beach and the ability to provide true experiences to those looking to travel. Now I'd like to bring John Molina, former board member and current developer here in the city. He accompanied us to on our D.C.. Mission and pitched the city as well as his current project. Thank you.Pete.Thank you very much. I'm John Molina. Thank you for letting me speak in front of you, Mr. Mayor and council members. I've been on the board of the CVB for many years. I just recently got off the board.Ironically, I wasn't in the hospitality business when I was on the board. And now that I'm getting into the hospitality business, I'm getting off the board. You see the result of what these folks do? You see them when you go downtown in restaurants and you see the conventioneers walking around with their badges.You see them every time. It's August, September, and you're looking at the budget. You see how much money they bring in. You see the wonderful projects every year or two that Steve Goodling and the crowd of the CVB comes in, whether it's the Pacific Ballroom or Bogart's or the Fountains or the or the bridge.But what you don't see is the hard work that goes in behind it. And I had the opportunity a couple of months ago to go on a Washington, D.C. trip. And sit with the folks from the CVB and the other hotels in Pitch Long Beach.You have no better ambassadors for this city than this group of people. They love the city. They work hard. They know their city inside and out. And they really bond connect with the people that they're trying to get out.From, whether it's Washington, D.C. or New York or Austin, Texas. And believe you me, there is a lot of competition for this business out there. And these folks do a fantastic job. They build the relationships and they sell the city.For every dollar.You invest, you get $6.Back. That's a pretty good deal. And what Steve and his team have done in the convention is really invest in the long term for the city. And I have the pleasure of introducing a video that shows our experiences in Washington, D.C..I could do testimonials for Long Beach forever, only because it's near and dear to my heart. We have had the best experiences here because of contracting the space and working with the CVB and working with our sales people at the hotels.And every single hotel goes out of their way to make sure you.Have exactly what you need and they're with you the whole way through as the CVB is, as your convention salesperson is.And all of the staff at the convention center.Because there is such.A connection, the passion that they have.For the destination. It's contagious.And we end up for unit falling in love with the city the same way because they're truly invested in their city. And it shows. I loved Long Beach because of the sense of true partnership I get and bringing my meeting to their city because again, it starts with the Convention and.Visitors Bureau down.Pension center.To the hotels, to the.Restaurants.The whole.Entire city.And you walk away feeling, I have a true partnership with Long Beach. The Long Beach CVB is.Such an extraordinary partner for event planners. They know the city in their hands. And at the same time, there's a lot of cooperation with the different organizations within the city.The building works with us when we're moving stages. Three days before the event starts, all hands on deck, whether it's the fire department, police department, the building itself.We also had a very special situation.We really wanted to do a party on the beach in Long Beach since we were there.And the club went to bat for us, called in a lot of favors so we could actually do a beach party.On the beach. So it was great and they were great.We came in and we were actually fashion first floor. You know, that's kind of our concept. You got to have good lighting to show color. And the lighting and convention center wasn't the best. So within 24 hours, we had an answer from Steve and the crew at the Convention Center in the CVB, letting us know that they'reguaranteeing they're going to put in new lights for our group.And one of the key things that Long Beach did differently than any other destination we've had the pleasure of working with, is that without asking, without prompting, I received an economic impact statement.We were able.To see directly that our meeting allowed people in the.Destination to.Work during that week.So kudos to.Long Beach for offering that.Without me asking. Everybody goes above and beyond the call of duty to try.And make sure.That your program is outstanding. And they want you to come back. They want you to have a great experience. So you'll want to continue to come back. And we do the top notch. It's wonderful. I think in the.Convention center, for instance, I had.A meeting. We were in a ballroom. I needed some cushy chairs for my panel discussion. And no question, the my convention services person picked up the.Chairs from outside, brought them.In. Done. And you don't always get that kind of service at a convention center. It's great. You know what? Honestly, I have to say, you know, I know that people say things because they think it's the right thing to say.But I'm a very honest person and I can tell you, I love Long Beach. They are the most terrific, terrific place to be. Long Beach. The people are great. The venues are great and they really take that personal touch.They really do. They take a personal touch to make sure that your event goes well, that you're happy.And the people are as friendly as they appear.They are definitely.Very easy to work with. They are willing to.Be flexible.And create spaces, even in spaces that they have already set.Up, that you can do something new and different with your event.Working with the crew at the Long Beach Convention and Visitors Bureau is an amazing experience. It is so imaginative and innovative. I think those are probably the most innovative cities in the country. The world. This year was best in the West.Maybe next year will be best in the U.S.. Mr. Goodling talked about the Gaylord talked about what's going on in Portland, in Sacramento. I'm biased, but those folks don't hold a candle to the uniqueness of Long Beach with our convention center and the hotels and the waterfront and the restaurants, etc. But we need your continued support toput on a top notch CVB to return the money back to you. Now I'd like to introduce John Thomas, who I'm sure you all know, who's also a board member. People.Good evening, council members. Mr. Mayor, nice to see you again. What also makes Colombia so unique is our collection of nonprofits.These non-profits work hard every day to leverage their resources to deliver services and programs that, frankly, the city couldn't deliver and maybe that the public sector cannot deliver. The CVB has.Long enjoyed a relationship with these nonprofit partners. It's been strategic in our values and our mission statement in the city as well as in all the districts to assist where we have an opportunity and one special occasion.We'll be celebrating.Here pretty soon. Another month or two is our very own Ronald McDonald House, who's since its building in the city of Long Beach. And thanks to the CVB.Our hospitality partners.Our restaurants and catering partners.Not one meal has been missed at the Ronald McDonald.House because of these partners, and I think that's a very significant sign of how the CVB. Our partners play in the city.To make sure that our nonprofits are accommodated. Without further ado, I have a guess what a video to show you. I think it might be the last. Get it up, but we'll keep your video. And thank you so much for your participation in your support of the CVB.The CVB is beyond just events. They actually connect the community to other national resources and also build our capacity as an organization. The participants weren't all.Of the space.They were so proud to be Cambodian and they.Felt like they were valuable.Contributors to the larger.Society.Unfortunately, I've attended a lot of funerals in my time in the union and as president of Local 372, I can tell you I have never attended a service where a convention or center bureau or an organization like the CVB has gone to the extent.Long Beach, CVB have done. The CVB and the Convention Center gave discounted rate to the firefighters who traveled from across the nation, and they were given a discounted rate, which was absolutely a blessing to our people.What's been wonderful this year is that the CVB actually became one of our corporate sponsors. And that's wonderful because what it really does is it promotes the bridge building between two organizations within Long Beach. And what everybody wants is to always be included.Everybody wants a seat at the table, and anytime you go to CVB, they make sure that happens.You know, as nonprofits, you know, we all.Have our.Specialty.Like Central Cha, like the core of the Cambodian community. And we were given a specialty chef who designed our.Food for.Our events to celebrate our.Culture. So really, because I know that they will do.So much for.Us that we won't have to do and I don't have to stress about it. I know it's going to be a successful event. They work with the nonprofits. They want us to succeed. And that's so.Rare. There was this unused space and and the people at the CDB had a fantastic vision for it. They redecorated it. They opened it up, made it beautiful and new, and brought these different performing arts groups. And here we are and we're part of it.And we're so excited to be part of the Beverly O'Neill Theater. Thanks to the CDC.Let's face it, the CVB works daily on trying to get the word out and bring attention to our great city. They've increased marketing, which is helping all the arts and creating greater awareness in the community. And I think they do all this because they understand and value the importance of quality arts in our community.One of the most visionary initiatives that they've launched in the last few years that has greatly benefited the symphony and all the artistic partners is the creation of an arts brochure that publicizes all of the different happenings at the center.And we are so fortunate that they provide that kind of marketing support, and it's a brilliant idea.They are more than a convention center. They are our best friends, and that's for sure. They were step by step and made that.Unique experience.Marvelous.It has become a dynamic force for the city of language.We have groups, we have so many nonprofits in this region, and they utilize the facilities for their fundraisers. Plus, they're charming to work with and they work hard.When you call the city, you're not just renting a room. You're not just getting a meal. You really are getting in touch with people that care and they care deeply. And you just can't find that other large cities.They love plumbing.And they know the value of.What makes Long Beach beautiful.Which is the diversity.What people also don't know about the Convention Visitors Bureau is that.They also support the.Youth, but that's part of their community involvement, and they've done that for many years without asking for us to broadcast that.They have pride and community because they invest.In this community. Great.On behalf of our entire tourism partners behind us, if I could ask our CVB staff first to stand so we could thank them for their hard work this year. And as all of you know, without our convention center partners, we couldn't even begin to do what we do.If Charlie Byrne and your team, Veronica, if you could all stand as well. And our hotel partners. You heard about it, the rates that were given for the fire. Sadly, what happened with Captain Rose this year and others, again, it's a great partnership.So could all of our membership stay if we could just thank them for doing what they do? The best thing. And I think Beverly O'Neil said it, and that is we're Long Beach. We're collective. Not only does this entire group sell the city every day.Not only do we welcome conventioneers and let them know that we what we can do for them. But we're also bringing in press. We're showing them how to sell the city. And beyond that, we're working with our nonprofits because if they're successful, we're successful.And that's what we should be doing. So all these folks behind me make it all happen. We appreciate your support in making it happen. And again, thank you for another wonderful year.Thank you so much, Mr. Goodling.

    "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\n05870587 counsel as Lara and Fernandes, Sanderson offered the following order for a hearing to discuss the impact of inequitable housing code enforcement. In Boston's proactive rental inspection program.Thank you, Mr. Clarke. The Chair recognizes counsel. Our counsel over at U of the floor.Thank you, President Flynn. And thank you to Counselor Fernandez Anderson for co-sponsoring this matter with me. We all know that asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that's responsible for about 1.8 million annual emergency department visits in the U.S..It's also the leading cause of childhood morbidity. It is a preexisting condition that we have seen exacerbate COVID 19, increasing the risk of hospitalization and death disproportionately for black and brown people in the city of Boston. And housing has been shown and housing quality in particular has been shown to be critical determinants of asthma, particularly for childrenwith more. Excuse me. With more than 44% of the risk of childhood asthma diagnosis being attributed to exposure at home. In 2013, the city of Boston passed the Proactive Rental Inspection Ordinance, which implemented a proactive rental inspection program that requires owners of all nonexempt units to undergo inspection every five years.Last month, Harvard released a ten year study of our housing code enforcement, specifically for reported asthma triggers, which showed a 17% longer median response time, 14% higher probability of cases being overdue, and a 54.4% lower probability of repair in neighborhoods that have the lowest proportion of white residents in the city.We know that renters typically are slow to report this type of incident for fear of retaliation. And so we can expect that the number of people that are living in private rental units and are being exposed to asthma triggers are much more significant than what we see here.I believe that there's really an urgent need to strengthen code enforcement systems and programs like Breathe Easy at Home and the proactive rental inspection program if we want to protect the health and safety of our tenants, particularly in the city's most marginalized communities.As the chair of the Committee on Housing and Community Development, I'm committing to ensuring that our constituents not only have access to ample affordable housing, but that the places that they call home are also safe and healthy. I'm calling this hearing because our current interventions have proven to be plagued by the same systemic racism that we seein all of our city agencies. And I think that a policy failure is going to require a policy solution, and I hope that we can get to one here. Thank you, President, for.Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Lara. Um. The chair recognizes Counselor Fernandez Anderson. Counsel Fernandez Anderson, you have the floor.Thank you. Counsel President. Thank you, counselor, for for inviting me and ask and inviting me to partner with you in this. So I guess, just to reiterate not what, which, what hasn't been said, right? So you put that so eloquently.In short, I think if you live in a predominantly black neighborhood because of the intersection between like, you know, systemic racism and class inequality, that neighborhood is more likely to be poor working class. So then obviously predominantly white neighborhoods than they are predominately white neighborhood counterpart.And I think because of this, to reiterate the example documented here, though, we could just as easily discuss other examples. Obviously asthma and other conditions that come with lack of inspections in in these communities obviously impact the communities disproportionately in a negative way.So thank you again and I look forward to hearing with you. Thanks.Thank you. Counsel Fernandez innocent. Is anyone else looking to speak on this matter? The chair recognizes Constitution. Constitution? You have the floor.Thank you, Mr. President. I rise in support of this talk. But also to say that one of the reasons why it's incredibly important to have is doing inspections is because people are so afraid already to withhold rent when it is their right, when they're not being provided an apartment.That is up to standards. We see it time and time again. People are paying for for apartments that are not quality. Right. But they feel like if they don't pay the rent, even though they're not getting heat or even though they're, you know, living in subpar conditions, that they're still required to pay rent.When they're not they are required. They are able to withhold rent. And the more we get ESD out there to inspect the apartments, the more people will feel empowered that they can actually withhold that rent that they can.And so I think it's important that we have see out there also so that our neighborhoods, our people in our neighborhoods feel like they can take ownership, even if they're just renting. What's coming out of their pocket and what's coming out of their pocket meets the value of what they're getting.So just right in support. And I think this is a really important conversation. Thank you.Thank you. Counsel. Again, the chair recognizes counsel role council. Will you have the floor?Thank you, President Flynn. And thank you to the Makers counsel Laura and Anderson Hirono to point to some staggering data around preparing items that are health hazards have received pictures of unhealthy living living situation from rodents, cockroaches and mold.As a city, I believe that we should be looking towards a more proactive enforcement does not that does that rely on tenant reports? For example, in 2003, the Greensboro City Council enacted their own certificate of occupancy ordinance and required mandatory inspections for essentially all rental housing.And after they enacted their ordinance, they saw that code violations dropped by 77% in eight years and that the city was able to bring more than 8700 properties up to a minimum minimum standard over the course of four years.I'm looking forward to working with the makers of ESD to ensure that the resources that we are able to enforce and strengthen the policies on inspection repair.Thank you. Thank you. And you want your name? Absolutely. The chair recognizes counselor Brad and counsel Brad and U of the floor.Thank you, Mr. President. I also want to thank the makers for this very important hearing order. And it also dovetails very nicely with some work our office has been doing on the issue of scofflaw landlords who do not keep their properties up to code and deferred maintenance and etc. without.And usually the code enforcement finds is just a cost of doing business. So we're working on that. The other issue that we are addressing in this context with regard to that issue is looking at the capacity of our Inspectional Services Department and making sure that they have the technology to actually be more effective in enforcing the codes. And and my understanding is being that, you know, they have been using basically a paper and pencil and paper, a pen and a paper approach, and that they do that the addition of added technology such as iPads, so they can do a field report in the field and have photographs and log.The conditions will expedite and be much more effective in enforcement. So always with any of these questions, I echo your concerns. Mr. President, we when we bring in new rules, new mandates, it's really important to ensure that our Inspection Services Department is equipped and has the it has the appropriate level of personnel to be able to bean effective enforcers of the code. So thank you so much.Thank you, counsel.And please have my name tag incarcerated.The chair recognizes. Counsel me here. Counsel, I'm here.So thank you, Mr. President. So I just want to rise and support and thank the leadership of the Housing Committee for spearheading this council a lot of for your and relentless leadership and all things that deal with housing.I really do appreciate and love how you lead in this space as well as council. Fernandez Anderson I'm really looking forward to the work and not only just having the conversation but really putting in the systems that are going to help support your vision.So please add my name. Thank you.Thank you. Counsel me here. Anyone else like to speak or add their name? I will. I will. I want to say thank you to the makers of this important hearing. I also want to highlight what counsel were all mentioned.The important role pest control plays in healthy living in apartments especially. But they contribute significantly to a decline in our public health our our our health for our children. So dealing with pest control is also a critical role.I know several of my councilors have mentioned that, but that's an important and important subject. And I just want to thank all the councils for the important work they're doing on this.

    "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nLet's do 68 since it's restaurant related and then we'll go back to the dashboard and the health order issue and COVID. So the 68. Then, then 48 and 65.Report from Economic Development Recommendation Receive and file a report on the restaurant retention strategy citywide.Mr. Modica.Here. Mr. Keisler can give a brief staff report of the committee's recommendations.Excellent honorable mayor and members of the city council. Thanks so much. As you know, the Economic Development and Finance Committee of the council takes items from the council to review and recently had a meeting on December 1st. Went through some of the background of actions taken by council since August 18th to support the restaurant sector in LongBeach. Of course, there's a lot of survey data that we presented to the Economic Development and Finance Committee. We recently had an economic forum as well to see just how hard this industry in particular has been hit, both businesses and workers, and how it's impacted employment.In L.A. County. Almost 200,000 jobs lost in just the last few months. Know in Long Beach, of course, over 25,000 of our unemployment claims are from accommodation and food services. This is our largest group by far in terms of raw numbers and percent of total claims.And so we know that both business owners and workers are suffering in this industry. Now, the core components of our restaurant retention strategy, we looked at eight different core components that we've seen and plans ranging from research to technical assistance and some of the other things that we've already implemented as a city.But the committee really wanted the council to focus on key performance measures, things like the percent of restaurants retained, the percent of jobs preserved, promoting equity across the city, improving the actual business and sector resilience, assessing of an individual business, health and strength, and then improving outreach and education so that we have a better ongoing communication withbusiness owners. And then in terms of the committee recommendations, adding to those core components I just mentioned, there were seven key areas that have to do with developing a really comprehensive and equitable restaurant retention strategy, not just a reactive one full of activities, expediting application and approval processes, approving an urgency ordinance related to delivery fees.Adopting a resolution to prioritize restaurants in our next round of federal stimulus. Providing regular public reporting on the distribution of federal stimulus funds like the CARES Act, and specifically identifying any available funding that we might reallocate to the industries like restaurants that are experiencing the greatest impacts.Expediting and simplifying the business grant application that businesses have to go through to access those funds and reduce the documentation that's needed just to apply, and then having shovel ready projects in anticipation of future federal funding. We know that we've got to have a strategy that has projects ready to go to be funded the moment those dollarsare ready. So finally, in terms of next steps for a restaurant retention strategy discussed with the committee will be starting tonight just incorporating those city council priorities that you would like as a staff to add to this this plan and identifying available funding at the local level, taking action now on urgent items and things we can doeither at the administrative level or with city council approval in the coming weeks. We need to complete a research report using an industry expert that knows the restaurant industry. Continuing our community outreach in our industry input. Adapting our emergency policies and urgency ordinances.And advocating for policies and funding from state and local or federal government. So our hope is, is that we can do things right now while we're developing this strategy. With that, I'll turn it back over to the mayor and city council for your input.Constable Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thanks. Thanks, John, for the presentation. Thanks for the many members that Economic Development Finance Council member Mongo Guzman Turanga. Not a healthy amount of discussion. You know, some themes that were were brought up during the committee meeting I think needs to be highlighted here.It was a lot of discussion about scope, accountability, transparency and expectations. We know that there are significant losses the restaurants are doing. And the reality is a lot of the programs we put forward there, we've done as best, the best we can.But it's not going to make hold all the losses the residents, the restaurants have taken. However, when we think about the policy changes we can make, for example, the committee made a recommendation to you know, we made a motion back in the committee, talked about third party platforms, delivery fees back in May and June.Still hasn't happened, but in the committee meeting we came back and made a recommendation, bring the council to say, let's do this with urgency now with delivery fees of 15%. Those are some of the things that can make a difference in terms of the bottom line now.So with the restaurant retention strategy, what we're really interested in are short term, immediate term and long term things that we can do to help make make the, you know, how actually have a plan to make our make our survivability, our survival rate of restaurants a bit higher.And so the first thing I want to do is obviously, I'm going to make make a motion to accept all the recommendations here. But I want to ask about specifically one of the parts related to the the third party platforms.The committee made a recommendation to council to give direction to create an ordinance with urgency capped at 15 at 15%. Mr. Chrisler, can you speak to that?Absolutely so. So we have actually taken this up as part of the Economic Development Commission. That was the initial review in in our July agenda. And we actually talked with restaurant owners who are experiencing this challenge to understand, you know, what the what the costs are, how it impacts their business and their bottom line.So we now have some research. We're going to be sharing that with the city attorney and to to identify what would be in a similar ordinance in some of the other cities nearby. And then if we can bring that back to council, our goal would be in the the first part of January.Of course, we will need to review that and put some language together. The city attorney obviously would need direction from council. So we would have to just sequence that process in a way that is acceptable. So we're ready to go with our research and we'll we'll communicate to you what those next steps are.Fantastic. And and so, you know, as I wrap up with with my motion as two things, it's one, I think this fits very well with the motion we just received from the mayor. We talked about that. These are the strategies you've done the research.We looked at the National Restaurant Best Practices Plan. We've engaged healthy lobbies. We engage with our businesses and we have a plan that we can stand behind. And so I move these recommendations, and I also, within that motion, am requesting that the city attorney work with the with the Economic Development Department to come back with an ordinancethat caps restaurant fees and urgency ordinance, having restaurant fees at 15%. And so that would be my motion and and thank. Thank you. I think I have a second by councilman. Mango. Mango.Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to kind of speak again to how important the outdoor small business infrastructure relief will be that I discussed in an early item when I was spoken to the mayor, Mr. Chrysler. Mr. MODICA.And I guess my question to Mr. Heisler is now that you are. Headed in that direction. What kind of timeline do you see before businesses can apply for and receive this relief?Council member. So last week's meeting with the committee was really helpful in advancing some of these recommendations, which we've now brought back with some potential options for the city manager to take a look at. Of course, we need to coordinate across our different departments to make sure that we identify which funds are available in the existing Appropriationfor CARES Act. And so we should have something available for City Council in writing over the next couple of days, and I hope would be that we would be able to make sure that those funds are committed by December 30th, given that this is CARES Act funding.So we believe that that timeline is is possible. We also believe that we have a regular communication with the businesses in the restaurants that have outdoor commerce going on right now and have the permits in place and have also already incurred costs related to those improvements.So we believe this could be a program that could move very quickly. We just need to get all the technicalities in writing for city leadership to to review.Wonderful. Thank you. And when will we be receiving the financial report requested at last Tuesday's meeting?Absolutely. So we we have it for the economic support programs. We obviously track all of our our financial information. That's the same on the same timeline. In a matter of days, we will pull that in, likely communicate that information also in a memo format and provide that to the city manager.So that's available for for council review. But we have that information and we're happy to provide it.And what steps were taken when the request was made to ensure that that information was provided timely. Because it seems like it's been seven days that we don't have that information yet. And it seems like from a position of a budget manager that and again, I know this is not just your division, but if we have $40million that it needs to be committed and extended by December 31st. We approved this in May, and one would think that we would have budget status reports and updates on a regular basis so that this council could have made decisions at this meeting.I'm related to. Underutilization or underspending by some of our contract providers so that we could have made sure to put that money into the hands of others. I was glad to hear from Mr. Modica and we've had several conversations.I just think it's important to to kind of have this dialog again that. But that we won't be leaving any money on the table. I think that that's important. I think that when there's any dollar available, the Long Beach workers and Long Beach businesses, we need to make sure we have it.But I would just strongly encourage and I wanted to make the statement publicly that whenever we receive funding, that there should be at least monthly updates available, not necessarily published to the Council, but available upon request. Should there be a need to make a pivot and I know we're in a a new economic time, but I justwant to make sure as the next set of funding comes down, that those those controls are in place. Because businesses and workers are counting on us. And then lastly, I spoke with a member of the press who asked about some of the.Ideas that are brought forward in this recommendation. But it's my understanding in talking to Mr. Keisler that the strategy as a whole would really be part of what we're asking the contractor to do.Your council member, too. So the the we're asking an industry expert to to review our our economic data related to to restaurant activity. So the consultant will provide an economic analysis of how we compare as Long Beach to maybe some of the regional and national standards, those retention rates, which the percentage of of these businesses that areat risk. So we'll really be looking for guidance on the economic information. But then when it comes to developing the strategy, the staff will actually be taking the lead on that. That's something we can do in-house with the input that's being provided, of course, by the consultant, but also by our industry experts, our local businesses.We've been meeting with them regularly and ultimately receiving their feedback as well. So that that report, the strategy itself, will be prepared in-house.And that will be back to us in January. February. What's our timeline?Yeah, absolutely. So so our expectation is that we can have our our or outline our draft report in in January. And our goal is, of course, we're going to be talking about the economic recovery strategy. We want to have that that done and ready to go as soon as the the second quarter of 2021, because, as youknow, we move forward with health orders and in the COVID situation being stabilized to have shovel ready projects as soon as business can resume or as soon as federal dollars are available means we've got to move quickly. So that doesn't mean that we can't bring you one off items, urgency items like the cap on delivery fees orlike the restructuring of a grant program. Those we'll bring to you as soon as those ideas are available and we can get them on the agenda. The overall strategy that's waiting for some of this economic information, some of the economic equity studies that we'll talk about it next council meeting on Tuesday.Next Tuesday, that that just is going to take a little bit more time for that data to arrive.Councilwoman, your 5 minutes is.Thank you. Thank you.Thank you. Next up, I have. Who is here. This is Councilwoman. I'm sorry. Councilmember Aranda. And then councilmembers in the House. Thank you, Eric. And I want to commend the economic model for bringing this forward. We had a great meeting last week.A lot of great ideas are out there and they're really working hard and trying to deal with this COVID 19 pandemic and getting projects ready for implementation once we are over this. So I want to thank John and his staff for all the work that you've been doing.It's been creative, somewhat frustrating. I can understand that because they are there are limits to what they can bring forward and the council to consider. So I'm fully supportive of Councilmember Retreat into motion. Thank you and good. Get support on the rest of the city council.Thank you. Country councilmember, actually councilwoman in the House.Thank you, Mayor. I also would like to thank the Economic Development Department. Thank you, John, for all that you and your team are doing to help our businesses. I know that the businesses in my district have benefited greatly from all the programs that that you've been putting forward.So I'm really excited about this. This restaurant retention recommendation that you guys are making on this program, I think is going to be very important moving forward. One of the things that I wanted to ask Councilmember Rex Richardson is if with your motion, maybe you could if it would be okay to include maybe what the feasibility wouldbe of those 33/3 party charges that are being made through delivery services and what the feasibility could be if the city could actually subsidize those. That 15% cap for our, you know, maybe getting some funds down to us.Would that be something that maybe we can include in in that?Council member. I've become unclear on on what it is. Let me tell you what I think I heard and said. We're going to direct staff to come back with the cap of 15%, but also create a program to subsidize restaurants so that we.May not necessarily like create a program, but maybe bring back information on the feasibility if it's even possible to be able to help out the restaurants with that 15% cap. Because I know that even even the big restaurants, but also including the smaller restaurants, that fee can be really hard on them, especially right now when we're inthis economic credit crisis. So I was wondering if maybe.I think I think I think staff in. Look at that. So I think it's what I'm hearing is, you know, because what we're talking about is the fees that the restaurants are charged by the third party platforms for instituting a cap simply because, one, they're they're dependent on those now they don't have indoor or outdoor dining.So, yes, we should cap it. But if you're talking about relief for that, I that that exists. I think that to be within the realm of how, you know, whatever support funding we have, you know, we can put that in the mix.I agree. So I think so. I'm I'm okay with accepting accepting that feasibility that question before born feasibility on it.Thank you. Thank you. I think that it's very important moving forward.Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Pierce.Thank you. I think most of the comments were were said before me that I wanted to make. I fully support putting a cap on that third party platform. I know in Long Beach we've got a lot of local places that are trying to to do those deliveries for our restaurants.And being able to see more of that during this difficult time would be great. Thank you.Councilmember. Councilmember.Did you guys not hear my comments?That's right. No, I did. I did. I'm just waiting. I wasn't sure you continue. Our staff was waiting on something else.No, I didn't ask any questions. I just gave my input and said thank you. Okay.Let me I don't I don't have any other councilmembers lined up yet, so why don't we just go ahead and do another public comment on this? Yes, we have De Shukla. However, if you go on file just like the stuff my support for, which should hopefully become a model program.Thank you all very much for working on this. Thank you. That concludes public comment. Okay. Richard Clarke. Yes. That concludes public comment. They had somebody else. And I guess there there's no. Okay. So that we'll we'll close then do the roll call, please.And the woman's in the house. I had to remember Pierce. And to remember Pierce. Councilwoman Price.I.COUNTERMAN Supernanny.All right.

Speak to the item council.Okay. Okay. Awesome. And thank you. I just have a couple comments. I pulled this item because I think it's really important that we support local businesses. And I wanted to understand, like, how much industrial tire the local company is getting on the contract.And I also want to make sure that our local procurements and preferences are more than just, you know, window dressing, that when we're awarding these these companies, these local companies, that they actually also get a significant amount of the contract because, as we all know, local businesses strengthen our local economy and communities.And I know that later on today, we're going to be talking about the procurement study and the 250,000 that's allocated for this. And I think it's very important that we look at minority owned businesses and disadvantaged businesses right here in our backyard.And I also in the future, I want to go further. I would like to see that on these RFPs and local business that we give a greater local preference to local businesses. I don't know what the preference is right now if it's 5%, but I would like to see it somewhere around 15%.So I look forward to bring in that item later on this year.I think there's a there is a much wider public comment on this item that was pulled.

Thank you, Edson, for the staff report. Councilmember Kasich, would you please put Council Bill 22, dash three, four, three on the floor for final passage.I move that council bill 20 2-0343 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.Thank you. It has been moved and seconded the required public hearing for Council Bill 20 2-343 is open now we have the staff report, please.Yes, thank you. My name is Libby Adams. I'm with Community Planning and Development, and I'll be presenting the MAP Amendment to allow accessory dwelling units in Villa Park, Barnum and Barnum West. This application is sponsored by Councilmember Torres and the Map Amendment rezoning all single unit residential properties that currently do not allow for use in Villa Park, Barnum and Barnum West to allow for aid to use as it had previously. The application is located in District three, and so the request includes nearly 3000 properties or 439 acres bounded by Sheridan Boulevard, Federal Boulevard and then Alameda to the south and 10th Avenue to the north.And the proposed zoned districts are the same as the current zone districts, except that they allow the accessory dwelling unit use either within the primary structure or in a detached structure. The proposed rezoning area is currently zoned urban edge single unit D and urban edge single unit decks.Both districts are single unit residential districts, allowing the Urban House primary building form with a maximum height of 30 to 35 feet. Additionally, the Eastside District allows a suburban house building form. There's one historic structure in this area located at 666 King Street, so any development proposed on this site would be subject to landmark review.The area is mostly single unit residential land uses with some public quasi public uses scattered throughout and a small handful of two in multi-unit uses. And the proposed rezoning is adjacent to a single unit two unit multi-unit commercial office mixed use public, quasi public and park and open space.Here's some images from within the proposed rezoning with Philip Park on the top, then Barnum and Barnum West. And then here are some images from the surrounding area. And then for public outreach. The District three Council office began outreach in the summer of 2021 and included postcards, fliers, yard signs, meeting with registered neighborhood organizations, a dedicated phoneline, virtual office hours, virtual town halls, and in-person town hall, which is pictured here, and then a survey with 140 respondents. And these were both in English. We had bilingual, bilingual meetings as well. And so for the process, the informational notice was sent in the beginning of December and this went to planning board on March 16th wherethey unanimously recommended approval. And then for public comment, Councilwoman Torres included letters of support from the Community Coalition for Barnham and Villa Park Neighborhood Association with the application. And then during the process, staff received four letters of opposition, mostly citing concerns with increase in traffic, crime and trash.And then staff also received 33 letters in support, citing a desire to add an extra unit, particularly for family members, and to add density to the neighborhood. Additionally, the council office received mostly support for the rezoning from the survey they created.Because this rezoning is legislative, it is only subject to the three review criteria shown here. The first review criterion is consistency with adopted plans, and there are five plans that are applicable to this rezoning. The proposed MAP amendment is consistent with several strategies from Comprehensive Plan 2040, which are outlined in the staff report.So moving to Blueprint Denver, the future of the future neighborhood context is urban edge. And so the proposed zone districts are consistent with this plan direction of predominantly residential areas with single and two unit uses. And then most of the proposed area for the future place type is low residential and these are mostly single and two unitareas where 80 ewes are appropriate. The northern portion located in Villa Park is in the low, medium residential future place type, which is a mix of low to mid scale multi-unit residential options which allow for single unit with 80 ewes.And then there are small portions along corridors that are designated as local and community corridors which I permit primarily for shopping, dining and commercial uses and may also include residential uses. So overall, the proposed districts will expand the allowed residential uses consistent with all three of these future place types.And most of the future street types are local streets and residential collectors, which are mostly characterized by residential uses consistent with the proposed rezoning. And then under the Blueprint Growth Area Strategy, a majority of the area is within are expected to see 10% job growth and 20% housing growth by 2040.And then the areas along shared in Alameda are designated as community centers and corridors and are anticipated to see 20% of new jobs and 25% of new housing by 2040. So the additional 80 use permitted by this proposed rezoning are consistent with the strategy.And then blueprint also includes other specific policy recommendations. So policy for of the land use and built form housing section says they've tested diversify housing choice and through all of our residential areas in the city and then policy 11 of the land use and built form general section provides guidance to implement plan recommendations through larger scale legislativerezoning such as this one and then policy five of the land use and built for general section focuses on the importance of mitigating and voluntary displacement, which I'll discuss in the coming slides. So all large map amendments should be guided by the equity concepts detailed in Blueprint Denver.The Access to Opportunity Score is a composite of the neighborhood equity indexed event developed by Denver's Department of Public Health and Environment. Proximity to high capacity in frequent transit and access to centers and corridors. These neighborhoods have moderate scores in this category, with lower access to health care, grocery stores and transit, and high access to parks incenters and corridors. So the proposed rezoning to allow it to use throughout these three neighborhoods will bring more residents to an area that has access to job services and parks. And then the vulnerability to involuntary displacement score is calculated by the Department of Housing Stability and based on median household income, percentage of renter occupied units and percentageof residents with less than a college degree. And this area scores as more vulnerable, based on two of the metrics median household income and educational attainment. So the proposed MAP amendment will provide opportunities for existing homeowner homeowners to supplement their income, while also increasing housing options in the neighborhood, allowing people with a greater range of incomes tolive in the area. And then this equity concept also includes supplemental data that highlights demographic and market changes in the area to give us a better understanding of the areas of vulnerability to involuntary displacement. So all three neighborhoods have a lower percentage of non-Hispanic whites than Denver as a whole, which could make it more vulnerable to displacement. And two of the neighborhoods have seen an increase in the non-Hispanic white population. And while Barnard West has seen a decrease. And then Villa Park Barnum and Barnum was all have lower median household incomes than than the Denver average.And Villa Park has seen incomes increase significantly, which may indicate that some displacement may already be occurring. And then the three neighborhoods have similar percentages and residents who are over the age of 65. But in recent years they have seen an increase greater than the citywide percentage.And then the neighborhoods within the proposed rezoning have all seen a greater increase in median residential property taxes than the citywide average, which again may make these areas more vulnerable to involuntary displacement. And then moving to the housing diversity score.And the housing diversity includes five measures percentage of middle density housing, home size, diversity, ownership versus rental housing costs, and the number of income restricted units. And then the neighborhoods have below average diversity in terms of missing middle housing, housing costs and affordable units.And this map amendment to allow it to use will introduce a new housing type that is typically smaller and at a lower price point than what exists today. Additionally, is constructed through the West Denver Renaissance Collaborative, an organization that helps finance AIDS are required to be income restricted and which could lead to more affordable units in thearea. And then lastly, this map shows the mix of jobs in areas of the city with the dominant industry depicted by color. So you can see this area shows a greater percentage of retail jobs in the city as a whole.However, there's not enough data in to classify the mix of jobs in the majority of the area, which is why it's not depicted by color in this map. And then it will have a negligible impact on jobs and that it doesn't allow for any commercial uses.And there are efforts underway in the West and other neighborhoods to help reduce barriers to ADA use, including the West, Denver Renaissance Collaboratives West Denver Single Family Plus Accessory Dwelling Unit Pilot Program. And this program allows moderate and low income homeowners design, finance and build an ADU in nine West Denver neighborhoods, including Villa Park, Barnum and BarnumWest. There are also resources to help with the permitting process that CPD has developed in the ADA use and Denver project is currently underway to make it easier to construct drives and make sure they fit within the different types of neighborhood contexts.So then host five year strategic plan was adopted this past fall and contains recommendations that are directly relevant to this MAP amendment. The plan recommends supporting efforts to advance affordable housing strategies and blueprint Denver, such as expanding its use.And then the Villa Park Neighborhood Plan applies to the properties that are north of Sixth Avenue. And so the land use and zoning recommendation strategy, too, recommends discouraging development that is incompatible with the scale and quality of the neighborhood, and adds are a way to introduce general density that will fit within the existing character of the neighborhood. And then the Barnum Barnum West Neighborhood Plan applies to the properties that are south of Sixth Avenue. And this rezoning will meet several of the land use and zoning goals, including maintaining the existing low density residential character, upgrading the quality of the present housing stock, and encouraging the construction of new low density housing.And this map amendment will result in the uniformity of district regulations within the urban and neighborhood context, in it furthers the public health, safety and welfare by expanding housing, diversity and opportunities to help residents at a range of income levels to continue to live in these neighborhoods.So finding that all review criteria have the Met staff recommend City Council approve this legislative proposal? And that concludes my presentation.Thank you, Libby, for the staff report. This evening, we have seven individuals signed up to speak. Our first speaker all are joining us virtually via Zoom. Our first speaker is Mara Owen.Can you hear me?Yes, go ahead, please.You mean devastate council? My name is Mark Owen and my address is 1035 Osage and the program manager for the West Immigrant Science Collaborative EDU Pilot Program, which is a program of the work with Habitat for Humanity and the city of Denver to help qualified homeowners design, finance and build affordable EDU on their residential property.So the EU pilot program began 2019. We have had 157 inquiries from West Denver homeowners. Without zoning, these homeowners reached out to our program. Interested in learning about building an affordable adu only to find out that their zoning does not currently allow it.Even if their neighborhood neighbor across the street or a friend in a nearby neighborhood can. Of those who did have zoning, the overwhelming majority of homeowners who have inquired to build an idea are hoping to house family, whether that's housing a grown child who is struggling to live in the neighborhood where they grew up.A parent in retirement, wanting to age in place near family, or a family member with a disability who needs a long term affordable housing option near their support network. In addition to housing families, aides are also a tool homeowners can use to create long term stability and prevent displacement.You can write a homeowner with additional income and flexibility to be resilient in the face of economic instability, such as job loss or sudden medical needs. There are now 42 individual homeowners in Villa Park, Farnham and Barnham West who applied to our program and are unable to participate currently because their zoning does not allow it.Supporting this rezoning would give those homeowners and many others in those neighborhoods access to the same tool and the option that many of their neighborhoods already have. Building an 80 year old house family create long term stability and economic resiliency to stay in place.Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak.Thank you. Our next speaker is Jessica Calderon.Hello? Can you hear me?Yes.Hi. My name is Jessica Calderon and my address is 613 Equipment Street. I am a resident of Villa Park. My history in the neighborhood is that. When I was two years old, my parents moved here from Texas so that we could have additional opportunities.We were from a very small town. Moved to Denver where I had an uncle Emmanuel, who lived on 10th and equipment. And so I spent my first couple of years of my time in Colorado as a two year old in West Denver.I went on to live in other areas of the metro.Before finding my way back.To West Denver with my husband, where we bought the home we currently live in.We spent a lot of time raising our.Three.Boys there and one one of which has recently passed. And so that is our family home. It is our foundation and and where we are strong together.Currently, I have a 25 year old son.Who has a child type of grandson.He could not buy a house in our neighborhood.If he wanted to because he's priced out.I have a 19 year old son who is a sophomore at Sea Boulder, and unfortunately, in two years when.He graduates, even if he gets a decent paying job, he likely could not buy a home in our neighborhood because he's priced out. I have.Aging parents who maybe someday would need to live.Near me. And so for those reasons, I would like the zoning change so that we can take this opportunity to build an EDU on our property, so that if our family needs support.And they want to be near us and they want to be in the neighborhood where we feel closest as a family, they would have the opportunity to do that. I also.If there were.Even if it weren't family or it's not needed by.Family right now, we could offer it to other people who want to stay in West Denver in a place that they can afford. If they don't want to leave the neighborhood.So for that reason, I am asking all of you.To consider passing the.Zoning for these adus.Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Rene Martinez Stone. Go ahead, Renee. You'll just have to unmute. Can you hear me? Yes.Okay. Great. Good evening. My name is Rene Martinez Stone. And my camera is not quite. Okay.Might want to. Tilted a little bit more. Renee.Yeah. My shirt is clean. Yeah. They got anything? Thank you for having public comment tonight. I'm a resident of Denver, and I'm the director of the West Denver Renaissance Collaborative. It is, or one of the new tools that can help current affordable housing needs in Denver.As you've heard tonight, there is a solution that do not require an existing home to be demolished. They utilize existing lots, locks, utilities, and they fit in the character of existing neighborhoods. This is welcomed by residents that are seeing a lot of change within their neighborhoods where affordable homes are being replaced by quite expensive homes.It is provide a way for residents to personally invest and be a part of the housing solution in the neighborhood. And this is very often cited by homeowners who want to build a use. If approved, this legislation, this legislative rezoning, eliminates the first step in a process that is complicated, costly and takes too much value time forhomeowners as well as staff. It's the type of regulatory regulatory change that's needed to increase the number of use built in Denver. Overall, there's just not enough. Our pilot program, which Mara introduced to help homeowners navigate the process of building affordable homes.We have 12 debuts in development, and our participants have been in the neighborhood on average 18 years, some over 20, some over 40 years. All of the units are ground level and many have 2 to 3 bedrooms. So their housing family is a family unit.83% of the participants identify as persons of color, and most have immediate need to house family. They aim to create multigenerational stability and secure a family asset. Just as Jessica described, is the desire to house family, students and school participants, the need accessible unit.And many residents have moved and are now doubled up living in another household because they can't afford. They are essentially homeless, temporarily housed by a friend or neighbor. I want to thank Councilwoman Scores for her leadership and responsive to the community.I want to thank many residents who did not understand their views but welcomed a solution for their neighborhood. And I respectfully ask the council advance this and future policy to help homeowners and renters access the relatively untapped.Time we have allotted fight. Speaker Thank you so much. We're going to go ahead and move on to our next speaker. Janice Morris. All right. We're going to go ahead. And I believe Janice is on the phone. And Janice, we'll have to have you go ahead and unmute yourself.It's Star six.I did.Oh, wonderful. Go ahead, please.Good evening, counsel. My name is Janice Morrell. I've lived in the Barnham neighborhood at two, two, two Lowell Boulevard for about 36 years. I bought this house from my aunt and uncle. I would like to be able to pass this house on to and create generational wealth for my kids.But at the same time, be able to if I'm able to build an Adu on my property, not only could I rent it now to my son or even to provide separate space for my daughter to visit. Or allow my in-laws a safe place to live.That would be awesome. This is one tiny step that we're asking you to pass to clear the way so that more of us can utilize our properties. In a better way. Providing for our families, providing for our kids.Maybe even renting to people that are new to us. Our neighborhood, I feel, is inclusive and welcoming. But I think that we also need in Barnum the ability to stay or age in place at the same time keeping the wealth of our homes.We're lucky enough to have bought in this neighborhood and we want to stay. So we're asking you to consider clearing the path, clear the road, so that we can stay in our homes and provide additional income for ourselves and or help support our family.Thank you for listening.Thank you. Our next speaker is Valerie Kotch. Do we have Valerie with us? Valerie, I believe we're trying to bring you in to the panelists so you'll have to accept the promotion. I'm still seeing you and the attendees.We'll try to get Valerie into the queue. In the meantime, we're going to go ahead and move on to Adam Calderon.And Evening City Council. My name is Adam Calderon. I grew up in Villa Park. I attended Cal Elementary Lake Middle School and graduated from Denver West High School. I'm also a proud graduate and alumni of the University of Colorado, Boulder.My home address is 613 Quitman. I would like to see aid use allowed in our neighborhood. I have a I have a mother who is a 38 year employee of the city and county of Denver who lives off of 11 miles.And she's aging gracefully, thank God. But one day it's my hope that we could build an 82 onto our property so that she could come and live with us. It strikes me because a couple of weeks back, my neighbor across the street, Judith, was taken away to a nursing home.She was he she's about nine years old. She specifically wanted to stay in her home, but her family lives too far away.I don't want that for far from me.I want to be able to provide the opportunity for my mom to stand with her family as she is. She gets older and ages gracefully. I hope that you will find it in your hearts to pass this so that we can continue to grow as a family and and keep our people in place.Thank you.Thank you. We're going to go ahead and try to get you into the queue, Valerie. So we're going to send you the promotion again for it. Our next speaker is Jesse Paris. Do we have Jesse with us? Okay.The producers are telling me that we seem to not have Jesse with us, so we're going to move on. Did we get Valerie? Into the queue. Okay. We don't have either of them. And so that concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash three, four, three.Councilmember Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. I wanted to ask if we could maybe have Renee Martinez Stone back in for just a minute. Yes. We'll go ahead and get her back into the panelists. Rene Martinez Stone. Okay. We've got her great back in the panelists.Go ahead. Humor. Renee, I wanted to ask you about. Whether or not we are seeing. An issue of some of the homes not having enough equity that affords the ability for borrowing against their property to be able to build the affordable adu on the property.And if if that is the case. Have there been discussions with the city about looking at funding to assist? This area of town in this particular these particular boundaries to assist the families in being able to build in aid to you.A lot of the applications we have seen come forward are our folks that may be in different economic. Categories, if you will. And I want to make sure that we create the same opportunity for people that may live in neighborhoods where the housing prices may be lower.And the either the value or the amount of equity that's in the home that could, you know, otherwise be used to help borrow the money to build and add to you. So if you can just kind of help address what efforts are in place or under discussion to try to ensure we're creating that same opportunity for folksin these neighborhoods.Okay. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Briefly, I will respond to participants within our program that we're piloting with the Department of Housing. Stability provides an affordable adu subsidy on any am I. And it reduces the cost of any of you by $30,000.So that goes with a 25 year restriction on who's ending you and how much the rent can be. That's quite means that an incentive for participants within our program. To your second question, the majority of the participants in our program do utilize equity in their homes because we when someone applied to the program, they get a bonusor they've been in the neighborhood a lot of time and so many of them have many years of home equity built up and they're utilizing that. We have seen a few homeowners who refinanced and did not retain those funds to build the yield, and they have a little bit more difficult time financing.We do provide housing counseling, which is available to most anyone in West ever that seeks it, even if they're not within our program to look at their options for stabilizing their situation. And so we observed of the 12 way to use that we have developed, there were 50 homeowners that participated in housing counseling.Just want to thank you for your efforts in working with the families in West Denver. I actually grew up in Westwood when I moved here from New Mexico and lived there for a number of years through graduating from West High School and Cowboys.So we had a speaker who was a West graduate earlier in. And so I think this is important work that you have been doing for these neighborhoods, and that's it for my question. So thank you for answering them.Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. And thank you, Renee, for answering those questions. We've got Councilmember Flynn.You're up next.Thank you, Madam President. Libby, could you tell us, was there discussion during this process about the rule that says properties with an ADU, one of the units must be occupied by the owner of the property. The reason I ask is I noticed that one of the supportive statements from a member of the public stated that that shewished that that would be taken away so that both units could be rented at some point down the road. Was was there discussion about that rule during the process?No, not to my knowledge. But, you know, I'm sure I can go if I see she's aware that she must live on the property to do NATO. But there wasn't specific lease. I didn't have specific discussion. I don't know if Councilman Torres at any of the virtual town hall.Madam President, could if Councilwoman Torres has information on that, could she.Got right into the queue. Councilman Flynn. So go ahead, please.The reason the reason I asked is I'm I am up in the air over the issue of ADOS and how they. Result in long term affordability. Especially when there's this requirement that the owner must live there. The reason being that assessor, the assessors figures show that in the last two years.240 242, 240 properties in Denver with 80 use on them were sold on in the open real estate market. The median sales price was $980,000. And it seems to me that once you put an ADU on a property, you have substantially escalated the the market price for that, which pretty much limits the the universe of buyers forthat. And I'm wondering if that's an aspect that's been examined.The. Absolutely. I can talk about the first question because it came up a lot while we were doing community engagement. So a lot of the community. Community meetings. Thank you.Okay. I think I can still hear.Okay. I think that came up frequently in residents wanting to make sure that that the city was very clear to folks who build to use that they know those rules and further really wanting to make sure that the city's enforcing those.So for, for example, a neighborhood association conversations centered a lot around how does the city enforce those rules? I think the biggest concern tends to be too many of them being used for short term rental. I think the neighborhoods are overwhelmingly interested in long term housing for folks and in particular for keeping residents housed who who currentlyown homes. Anti displacements are a key factor for that piece. It has been raised and I don't think we've seen a property turnover yet on that kind of price point for selling any to you. We certainly are seeing properties that are getting flipped that current that have the zoning for you to use that are not building themprobably to stay within a different kind of price point. But we just haven't seen the turnover yet on how homes that have built them and are now selling them. But it absolutely is still one of those tools for trying to keep residents there who want to stay and giving them either a source of income or a placefor additional family to go. So it has been that that largely that kind of source of the conversation for why folks have been supporting this, but still very much with an eye toward long term housing stability. Mm hmm.Thank you. You know, there's a lot of things to weigh here, obviously, and we don't have a track record long enough to be to be able to draw a strong conclusion if this rule limits the universe of buyers to those who are wealthy.Enough to afford almost $1,000,000 investment and then live in that property. Is that better or worse than removing the rule and having both units open as rentals to outside investors out of town? Investors. Out of state investors. So it's it's something I think we need we need a lot more data to learn from.Thank you. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilwoman Torres.Thank you, Councilmember Flynn.Uh, and we'll.Go next to Councilmember said.Thank you. I have some of the same tensions around support and opposition to use. I think it's. An incredible opportunity to keep families together, to keep people aging in place. And also, I've seen how it exponentially increases the value of land in a speculators market.And so I am to a little bit curious about if there's a plan or potentially putting into place some more parameters around. Making sure that they're being used for affordable housing and not just becoming an income stream for someone's Airbnb who you can't necessarily prove is there 50% of the time or not?We've seen that challenge with the Short Term Rentals Advisory Committee and people in our neighborhoods, but I don't know if we have a real plan to go back and figure out how to track this information better. Yeah. Thank you for that question.So I will say that because the Western Renaissance Collaborative is in this area, those units do have to be income restricted. And, you know, I don't know the numbers of what's being built under that program versus not. But so that's in place.And that will those who are required to be, like I said, deed restricted. And it's possible to tie all of these that are being resigned to a condition that makes them go through a pilot or a similar program like the West Denver Renaissance Collaborative, just to make sure.I think the challenges that the West Denver Renaissance Club also has income restrictions and so not everyone will be eligible for that program. And so I think I think that would be a challenge to tie it to that program or something similar, at least at this point.When we first heard the stories.Yeah. So thanks for the questions. And I'd also invite Rene if she had any comment on on those pieces. That's one of the critical for reasons why IWD RC is so valuable in the space, because they do apply a long term deed on that property.And I think that's only triggered because you're accepting funding in order to in order to access that affordability. And and they're deliberately working with families who might otherwise get pushed out because of property taxes or or because family really wants them to move to a larger location.So both of those have been the crux behind DRC. I think one of the things that we can do to support is to actually get a DRC type model elsewhere in the city. I think we've proven that it's very effective.I think we've proven that not just the navigation through the complicated process, but the access to capital in order to help build has been a difference maker that the families that DRC is working with is exactly who we want to make sure that they're able to stay.And and all of that is really working beautifully there. But there is a component that we can't control. We have not, though, seen a flood of 82 permits run for four properties that currently have a to use zoning in West Denver.So it's still a bit of a hurdle for any property owner in West Denver to build in to you.Yeah, I mean, I guess when we started with DRC, we were curious about how to have a parallel program in on the east side of Denver and would love to if anybody is exploring that, we would love to to do that.And I think the land trust is positioned well to do the 99 year leases to ensure that. So I think that would be great because we too, have, you know, contemplated what would it mean for me to pursue a legislative rezoning?Is it putting us more in harm's way because we now have, you know, these million dollar properties for speculators, or does it actually help us to do it? So I think it's a great opportunity and potentially can help us meet the need.I just really, really hope that we can do some intensive tracking and take on some responsibility as the city, make sure even in our rental registry we have a category to identify these to somehow show us in our portfolio where these exist and what kind of people are applying and what support they need so that we canexpand the work that we're doing. Thank you.Thank you, Councilmember CdeBaca. And I've been asked by the producers to ask folks if they're not speaking into their mikes, to please turn off their mikes, because apparently we need a few adjustments and that might be contributing to the feedback.And so thank you. Not seeing any other questions from members of council. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 20 2-343 Council Pro Tem Torres.Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Libby, for shepherding us through this process. This this has been one that was responsive to community and what a lot of folks really wanted to see take place, especially as we were moving through conversations with the West Area plan, where folks were really identifying the limitations of blueprint and what needed tobe allowed to get folks through. I think a really complicated and cumbersome process which is rezoning individual properties and just want to think, I think the the real initiator of of this model of thinking, which was Councilwoman Sandoval and really helping us think through what is a neighborhood wide process look like, what kinds of things do weneed to consider to make sure that we're hearing from folks that we're giving them an opportunity to find out more information and get questions answered? And then, of course, to the residents who came out to support in DRC, always, I think, when establishing the foundation of empowering residents with information both about land acquisition, about development, about zoningin general, but then really trying to make it part of our civic vocabulary, what an edu is, what purpose it can serve, and how to really make it accessible to families who were absolutely threatened with displacement and having to find somewhere else to go.They have made it as affordable as possible by partnering with Habitat for Humanity, by really being there to walk folks through the entire process. This is one of those efforts that in and of itself does not solve displacement in West Denver, but it absolutely puts a new tool in property owners hands that if they want to stayin Barnham, in Villa Park and in Burnham West, they have a new way to make sure that they can do that and then pass on an asset to their children and family members. So I. Very grateful for everyone who supported this.We started it nearly a year ago to my team and I really do think all of the folks involved and would appreciate a lot of support from my colleagues. Thank you.Thank you, Counsel Pro Tem Torres, and happy to support this this evening. I think at least in my neighborhood and others were following closely the edu conversation. And I want to congratulate you, Counsel Pro-Tem Torres, because when you look at this, it's nearly 3000 parcels, approximately 439 acres.And this is creating a path forward. One of the speakers spoke about adult children living with her, and that is a reality in the city and county of Denver today. And so thank you for your leadership on this.And I am more than happy to support it. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 22, dash three, four, three, please.Torres, I. Black I. CdeBaca, I.Clark All right.Flynn.I.Cashman can h. I. Ortega. Sandoval. I swear, I.

Number 22 with.Report from City Manager Recommendation to adopt a resolution authorizing the city manager to execute an agreement with the California Department of Cannabis Control to support the Long Beach Cannabis Program citywide.Looking for a motion in the circuit. Okay. Uh, Councilman Ranga, I want to speak to your motion. Okay. Councilwoman Sara, I was elevated. I had no clue. I think it's a good project, great sorrow.It's great to be able to have additional funding to support our cannabis program. Thank you.In fact, the councilman often thank you. Obviously, I support this motion. This is you know, we're not in the business of turning away resources from from the state. Obviously, we have some ambitious objectives here, particularly related to social equity and implementing that here.I'm kind of waiting to hear from the city attorney in terms of how and how you envision utilizing these resources to get there, but also support our program. City Manager, you want to give a brief back report?Yes. Emily Armstrong will be able to answer some of those questions. Emily.There. Can you guys hear me?Yeah.Okay. Yeah. So the $3.9 million that we're going to be receiving from the DCC will actually go towards the.Overall cannabis program.So what we're looking to do is to convert the provisional licenses in the state's process to annual. And through that process, we're also looking to streamline our operations and expedite them through the process. And so we're looking to hopefully cut the application process by half and then hire some additional staff in almost every single department with thesefunds. So it'll be a great a great resource for the cannabis program.Fantastic. Anything else, Councilman? All right. No, thank you. I appreciate that. And obviously, we will look forward to learning more time moves on. All right. All right, Councilwoman Allen.Yeah. Just a quick question. Can you clarify one of the ways in which the software can be used and can the funds be provided to applicants to help defray the business startup expenses?So this grant in particular does have some limitations. So this grant is not related to providing direct grants to applicants. This grant, actually, we're going to be hiring staff and consultants to basically help applicants throughout the process. And it does have some limitations in terms of the funding that we can do.So this is actually going to hire staff and consultants for regulatory compliance, application processes, things like that. There is some funding that's also going to be going toward website design and technology to hopefully streamline the communications with applicants.But it cannot be spent on direct grants or loans or anything like that.Okay. Thank you very much.Right. Thank you. Let's go to public comment. Very public comment on this item.We have one member of the public, Eliot Lewis. Please begin.Did you guys hear me? We can hear him. Yeah, no, I just wanted to make some commentary in general. It's nice that we're getting some more funds. You know, the state collects 900 million in taxes. They're redistributing 100 million.Not the best system. I really wanted to focus, although I think all taxes in cannabis are too high. I really wanted to focus on the cultivation and tax. I think we should completely eliminate the cultivation tax. We have two really big brands here.We're creating great cannabis culture. We have Fresh Bake and we have Wonder Bread all across the state. The governor included up in Sacramento, they're getting rid of cannabis tax. San Francisco's got rid of all cannabis taxes. Sonoma's got rid of cultivation tax.Humboldt is right behind it. We continue to tax cultivators at the same rate. Although there's been massive price compression and they're suffering, they're barely keeping their head above water. And again, it's not about me. It's about good policy.You know, we don't like paying the retail tax, but it's really cultivation that we need to focus on. Council did a great job of modernizing the other vendors. Now we need to focus on cultivation and you know, depending on what time it is, I don't have an orthodoxy on that.I was the one retailer that came out and said, Hey, with the pandemic, we're doing really good. Let's raise taxes temporarily, half a percent. And, you know, like cause and like, you know, of the Rockies and Hershey of Pennsylvania, we're creating a great cannabis culture here.Long Beach hashtag farmers is becoming a thing, and we need to cultivate that, no pun intended. And at the end of the day, like Long Beach got put on the map from nineties, rapper Sublime, all of these different things.Cannabis culture is going to be part of that. And I think it's really important, you know, more than just the money you got, you know, jobs and everything else at stake. And I want to say that the amount collecting the cultivation tax based on our research is, you know, a very small amount, around $1,000,000.You know, we're budgeted for 8 million, we're collecting 10.3 million. And as the reforms come in at the state, I suspect I suspect that number will be more. So stop taxing farmers. We need to modernize the tax code, especially as it goes to two cultivation tax.Get rid of it altogether. We got a $3.9 million windfall and this is happening up and down the state. Let's stay progressive on the issue. Let's stay modern and let's stay up to date. I think that's all have.That concludes public comment for you.All right, members, please cast your vote as well as the roll call vote.District one.I.District two.I.District three.I.District four.I.District five.I.District six.

The total cost of the liability renewal premiums will not exceed 1.1 million citywide.We have a motion. Thank you. Council member Austin.I certainly motion to support this because we need insurance, but I would love to have a staff report.Okay.Staff vice, chair, council members, we have a lot of insurance items tonight and they're presented by our human resources director, Alex Vasquez, and also our new risk manager, Randall Sellers.Good evening, honorable mayor and members of Council. My name's Randy Sellers and I'm the interim risk manager for the city of Long Beach. There's three separate items I'd like to cover with your permission numbers 22, 23 and 24.They all cover insurance and we buy them annually at the same time. The first item protects the city from liability, which pertains to claims from the public or others for negligence. Essentially, there's $50 million in coverage and it will be excess of a $5 million self-insured retention.We're self-insured for amounts now up to 3 million, but we're recommending that that be increased to 5 million. The $50 million is there to protect us from catastrophic losses. Then we're also requesting two smaller policies protecting us from aviation and aircraft risks.If we go on to the next item, we're recommending the purchase of excess worker's compensation insurance, and we're recommending that that retention, which is essentially a deductible, be increased from 4 million to $5 million. But we're also going to be getting a lot more coverage at the back end.In exchange for that, we're getting $50 million in coverage. Raising the limits from 100 million that we currently have to 150 million. And finally, the property insurance covers city vehicles, buildings and equipment, and that premium is paid for one third of it for covering the Queen Mary.So that concludes my presentation there. Relatively straightforward and routine matters we come to council with every year. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Austin. Councilwoman Gonzales. Okay. So any member of the public that wishes to address the Council on item 22.Why do we have helicopters? The suggestion is that there could be a problem with the helicopter. That's why we need insurance to guard against the risk. Why would you have that risk if we didn't have helicopters? The helicopter serves no function at all.At all? Has it ever stopped one criminal? Has that been proven? Has it ever stopped one criminal from his mount malfeasance? It has not. It is just something that we're spending millions and millions of dollars on. Not only mentioning the insurance, but the maintenance.Do you have any idea the maintenance costs of two helicopters? Why do we have to? We don't even need one.Thank you.

    "prompt": "Write a summary of the following meeting transcripts.\nMeeting transcripts:\nBefore a week. Okay. So thank you for that report. And then we have ten B, which is to review and discuss charter amendment timeline and issues proposed by the Council subcommittee. And there is an attachment on that one who's taken that.I think I'll start. And I want to start with that. These are these are in the opposite order I would have gone in. I just want to be clear that this list is mostly things that came out of my head.I don't want to say that it was I think our wires got cross. I had asked for it to be presented as kind of John's list plus where he thinks he remembers. Tony deleted the list that I had presented to Tony.Unfortunately for today, we wanted to get buy in off on any kind of proposed process for working through this. At the time that Tony and I met, we were really thinking we would be moving towards putting things on a march ballot.It turns out that depending on what we work on, there may be some things that can only go on a November ballot and that so but if we kind of start working towards a march, march date, that means those things that might be able to go a little later.We'll just have more time to discuss. If you I don't think yet, hopefully you had a chance to read this. But if you think about this, that this is that there's kind of three, three meetings, this first meeting to kind of see if there are general ideas within the charter that people do or do not want usto talk about. Now is a great time to to flag those. Tony and I will then take those to a workshop working with staff to to get input on kind of those general ideas, what the community is interested in doing.And then take the feedback we get, put it into some sort of kind of bullet pointed draft idea of how we might move forward and come back here for feedback. So the idea is that once rather than having a subcommittee that just goes off, write a bunch of stuff and comes back in December and says, We got, we've got it, we want to have a check in somewhere along the process pretty early on to make sure that everybody's agreeing that we're heading in the right direction and not heading off in someplace that the two of us think is awesome.But people don't. Once we have that, we would then probably go back to the after we get input from the council, we would go back out sometime in July to a second set of workshops for them for the for the issues to get further input.And we would be back to the Council between September and November, probably with a series of drafts with the idea of trying to get to December with a suite of it. Could be one thing, could be ten different issues.You know, this depends on what we decide to work on, but a potential suite of charter amendments that we would then put on the ballot for March and or November. Can I.Okay. Any questions? Comments? Anyone want to add? Anything?Yeah.Councilmember Avila So a couple questions for the workshop and workshop. Is it possible to just agenda as though so that members, other members of the council can attend? I appreciate the subcommittee working on it, but I also think that it would and I'm not saying that we would have to attend, but if it could at least beagenda, is it in accordance with our sunshine? That way we could. We could if other council members want to attend. I mean, I in particular would like to hear the input and everything else.So I think that's a question for both the city clerk and the city. Acting City Attorney Ken.Well, the the the rule is that you can it's not impermissible for a a member of the council to attend a subcommittee. You just can't participate in it. So if you're just there to listen, then we we wouldn't have to notice that as a council meeting per se.Right. But I wouldn't be able to like ask questions or anything. Right.Yeah. So if you if you want to participate in any respect, the safer course of action would be to notice it as a council meeting. And again, in order to do that, you know, there's certain timeline requirements that we would have to meet.So if you want to do it that way, then that's the city clerk know so we can get it agenda agendas properly.I'm sorry, Kirk. Did you want to add to that?We that rule require the seven days notice, and we could definitely just put out that to allow the whole council to attend and just to be cautious.And speak, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.That agenda that we say is allowing the council to attend and gives you that. But we also notice that no minutes will be prepared and it's not a formal.Yeah. Okay. Any other questions? Comments. I mean.My comment is kind of similar to Malia's. I mean, in workshop, there's a lot of media items that. You know, I pretty specifically remember what the charge of the revision was, and that was to kind of clarify the do's and don'ts of council members and like ranked choice voting, campaign finance, how we elect the mayor.You know, district elections. I mean, those are meaty issues that I don't think any of us had had an opportunity to weigh in on. So I'd be hesitant to, you know. Just have like a workshop and then it comes back to us and you know, we don't have a lot of input on it before a lot ofwork gets done on it. I mean, that's my my concern on those because, I mean, there's a lot of scope creep here that I'm a little concerned about. I mean, if the group has the the time, I guess they can do it.But I wasn't expecting something so ambitious.I mean, I've just been pushed.Back by vice mayor vice.The charge, I was told was, look at the charter, everything is fair game. So I'm not sure where where the where the limited scope came from. I think I just want to say, yeah, I, you know, whatever we want to do, the goal of Tony and I bringing this here was literally to get input on areas ofinterest and to lay out a process whereby the council would be brought in before the media work was taken care of to make sure that there was that discussion. Okay.I threw the chair.Through the.Chair. Thank you. I guess my point is those issues are meeting in mid April is three weeks away. So to have something ready, I just don't know if there's enough time to to discuss it and vet it through the community because those are some meaty changes that, you know.Just changes.Yeah. And so I I'm going to just chime in. I and I do appreciate the the work that the subcommittee did. I but I also concur, I think in part with what Councilmember Odie is saying. Some of this, and I certainly did say go over the charter with a fine tooth comb and see what changes you thinkneed to be done and triage it, because obviously you can't do everything at once and some things are more urgent than others. So the district election in ranked choice voting I think is a bit outside the scope of the charter.I mean, maybe that's arguable, but I, I do it. But, you know, some of these things like paid signature gatherer rules, I don't believe it's addressed in the charter now, but maybe it should be or maybe somewhere else.I do remember saying that at our swearing in that I think for a matter of public trust, something that came up in, you know, the last.Year.Is that so? What happens when a council member is found to be in violation of the charter, then, you know, what are what are the remedies? What are the actions? So I would say that's a.Little.Beyond clarify council interference language. So anyway, those are those are my thoughts.Councilmember Day So yeah, going into it, what I shared with um, Vice Mayor Knox White as well as the staff is my view that whatever issues that we pursued had to have some form of and I mean this in the classic sense, political legitimacy that is it had to arise out of some issue about which everyone understoodto be an issue. But by the same token, I don't recall us having been told that limit ourselves to issues. So while I myself might have held a hat that said, okay, this is how I'm going to this is the lens through which I'm going to look at issues.You know, I was open to listening to what the public had to have the public had in mind or what fellow council members had in mind. Now, if tonight fellow council members are saying, okay, we want you to limit it.Okay, well, that's the point of tonight is to is to help us.Okay. So are you saying these items are all in the charter or should be? Is that what you're saying?Oh, well, if you're asking me what I'm interested in as a council member, what I'm interested in as a council member is addressing issues regarding council member. What was the issue it being involved in employment and and and and kind of.Yeah. And fleshing out the the remedies. If the remedies are appropriate for the charter. I'm not sure they are, by the way, but if they are fleshing it out, I'm also interested in what I believe is at the top of my head.I believe in section two, Dash four, which has to do with qualifications for council members. And I think the qualifications to dash for says that if you're a federal legislator, state legislator or county legislator, you cannot be involved in commissions or things like that.And I would expand to Dennis for four reasons that I am happy to go into later. But I think it's to dash four, by the way. So so I am interested in in dealing with, you know. Dealing with the issues that our community dealt with in 2018.And I think that's an appropriate place. But by the same token, I think our charge was to look at other issues.So. So just for clarification, the the title of this is Review and Discuss Charter Amendment Timelines. So you say you look to the charter and you thought perhaps it should be amended to address all of these things.No, no, no, no, no. I am not bought into all those things I am most interested in to.This is not a mutually drafted document.No. Okay. Okay.Is that Councilmember Vela.Not.Giving to the late hour? And the fact that I think this this conversation might better suit us to a different time. I think what I'm hearing is perhaps there needs to be a little more council discussion on what the topics specifically are.And I think that there, you know, perhaps we could continue this conversation to the next meeting and with the specific mindset of we are we now understand that we're trying to set up a couple of workshops, but we're also trying to narrow the scope of what those workshops will cover.And if we could at the next meeting, all come with kind of what we think should be covered. We can have that discussion and then we can actually approve or set out a timeline.How does that sound to the subcommittee and then others? Oh, what's that? What do I need to do? Oh, we have to just.You're fine. I just to give you guys a little more background since your thinking about coming back, just for your mindset, please. The distinction that Vice Mayor mentioned earlier is in election code section 14, dash 15, and I can shoot an email off to you tomorrow.But it basically prohibits an employment type of anything that's related to employees. And you all are considered employees from being on the March election. And one more thing about the March election and putting anything on that date would the city would then be paying for participating in that election, which be in addition to anything to consider forthe March date as you're coming back just to open your head?No, that's helpful thing.Okay.Okay. And Councilor Brody, I just want.To clarify, because I was intimately involved in this. The impetus of this was that there was a charter provision that an investigator found was unclear and vague. So his recommendation was to look at that charter provision and kind of clarify the do's and don'ts, what's allowed, what's not allowed.And if you read the document, that was the impetus. You'll see that there is a process outlined to deal with that in statute. And I think that the city attorney could probably update anyone that's not familiar with that process.So I think we need to be careful and not overstep our boundaries and make sure that we abide by the statutes in that that the state as adopted in this area.Well, I am again, I think Councilmember Vella is correct that the hour is late and we will have a more productive discussion. But I think that anything should be able to be discussed. What we decide is something else.So, Madam Clerk, can we just continue this item? Do I need a vote.To do that or.Is that okay with everyone?Okay with you? Okay. All right. Okay. All right.So. So thank you. And then, Councilman Rudy, did you want to speak briefly on Tennessee?No. Let's just talk about it next time.Okay. So then we are at adjournment and I'm going to ask everybody if we could adjourn. We started the meeting on a happy note with the announcement of our new city attorney said they were going to end on a sad note because I want to adjourn the council meeting in memory of some people.Who.Who lost their lives in the last couple of weeks. One of them is Victor McElhaney. He was 21 years old, the son of my friend and Oakland City Councilmember Lynnette Gibson McElhaney. His mother attended our swearing in ceremony in in December.She was introduced, if you remember. And very tragically, he was a gifted musician studying at USC and just out on a Saturday night. And he and some friends were held up and he got shot and killed. And it's you know, there is nothing where you can say, but I want to do his memory, the honor of rememberinghim tonight. And at the same time, I want us to adjourn in honor of the I believe it's now 50 victims of the terrorist attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Last week, again, more a sense of gun violence, but maybe on a a little more positive note.I also want to announce that this Saturday, March 23rd at 6:30 p.m., I'm right here in front of City Hall. The Islamic Center of Alameda is presenting a solidarity vigil with Muslims. And so I hope that you all can attend and members of the public who might listen to this tape later, I hope you can attend, too. But if we could just rise and have a moment of silence and then this is adjourned. Thank you, everyone. Thank you all. Good night.\nSummary:",

I'm going to hand it over to you to walk us through the committee report.Thank you. Council president, colleagues, as we know, the council adopted the surveillance impact reports on existing technologies already being used by Seattle City Light and the Seattle Fire Department. This is part of our required work to comply with the underlying surveillance ordinance adopted in 2017 and refined in 2018 to implement our cutting edge surveillance ordinance.Our existing technology and computer programs undergo an extensive review process by the Executive Department. A community led surveillance working group and other stakeholders. While technology is vital to enable local government to provide services more efficiently to the public.Some technology can also have surveillance capabilities or privacy concerns that need to be evaluated with surveillance impact reports. As promised, we took the single counsel bill containing the five existing police department technologies introduced February 22nd and broke it into five separate bills.We heard them in our committee over several meetings. March 3rd, March 17, April seven. Thank you, committee members, for finalizing your amendments so that our City Attorney's Office could complete a thorough review of them. On April 7th, our committee amended and then unanimously approved these five surveillance impact reports on existing SPV Technologies.And that's what's before us today for final adoption council bills 12002400250026002720028. These five existing technologies are a911 recording in full license plate readers for patrol license plate readers, parking enforcement, computer aided dispatch technology and online crime reporting technology.Based on some feedback after committee, Councilmember Herbold is further refining a couple of the bills today. I support Councilmember Herbals amendments. These are the remainder of the so called Group two technologies. We also have Group three and Group for Surveillance Impact reports coming later this year, which again undergo a thorough review by our Information Technology Department andSurveillance Working Group. The good news from an accountability perspective is that it's not over after council's approval of these ordinances because then our City Auditor and Office of Inspector General will continue to review the technologies after we approve these reports.Thank you.Thank you so much, Councilmember Peterson. Councilmember Herbold, I understand you have an amendment to council Bill 1230247 to hand it over to you to make your motion.I moved to amend to Bill 12 0024 as presented on Amendment one on the agenda.Second.It's been moved and seconded to amend the bill as presented on Amendment One. Because remember Herbals, you are recognized in order to walk us through your amendment.Thank you. So this amendment adds a recital to the council bill recognizing the plan to transfer 911 dispatch to the new Community Safety and Communications Center and the need for an updated surveillance impact report to align with the new organizational structure.Once that occurs.Right. Thank you so much. Are there any questions or comments on Amendment One? Right. Hearing none while the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of Amendment One.For both. Yes. Whereas I. Lewis. Yes. Morales. Councilmember Ross. Thank you, Mosquera. I. Peterson. Yes. So what? Yes. Council President Gonzalez. I didn't favor not oppose.The motion carries the amendment is adopted and the amended bill is before the council. Are there any additional comments on the bill as amended? All right. Hearing no additional comments, will the Christie's call the roll on the passage of the amended bill?I'm sorry. I'm a little slow.No, that's all right. All right. Go ahead. Customers want.Thank you so much and apologies again. My comments are for both the agenda items ten and 11 of today's agenda, which are connected. These agenda items approve the Seattle Police Department and Parking Enforcement use of automatic license plate readers.As the patrol car drives around with an automatic license plate reader, it automatically scans every license plate it sees, records the number, and compares it with a list of numbers it is looking out for it. To be clear, it scans and reads every license plate it sees whether or not you are doing anything wrong or illegal.It is the automated equivalent of facial recognition software being randomly used by the police on every face they see and is an unacceptable infringement on privacy in my view. It is also important how the surveillance technology is being used.According to the Surveillance Impact Report, it is used to enforce Seattle's scofflaw ordinance, which I voted against. The scofflaw ordinance criminalizes people for being poor. If you cannot pay your parking tickets, you are declared a scofflaw and the city boots or tows your car or people who rely on your vehicle to get to work were forced tolive in their vehicles because of the housing affordability crisis. This can be particularly devastating with this technology. If the police drive past your car and you have unpaid parking tickets, if you cannot afford, the computer will announce that you should be booted or towed even if you are parked legally at the time.The Surveillance Impact Report also says that this technology is used to find people with outstanding warrants. Think about wanting a ride to a stop first for expired plates and then for an outstanding warrant. Before he was killed, this is technology used to allow the police to do more traffic stops like that.No doubt proponents of this technology will point to uses like Amber Alert. But the reality is you do not need a computer for serious issues like what would generate Amber Alert. Human beings will look down and will look for a car in an Amber Alert.You need to comply. You need the computerized technology only when you want to scan everyone looking for minor things like unpaid parking tickets. This is the technology of a surveillance state that prioritizes the power of the police over the privacy of ordinary citizens.I will be voting no on items ten and 11 authorizing the approval of this surveillance technology. Thank you.Thank you. Okay, colleagues, so we are now going to call the rule rule on item nine, which is Council Bill 1 to 0 024 in lesson or any additional comments.I apologize if I spoke out of turn for some reason, I. That's why I was confused and late anyway.Now, that's okay. That's okay. I just wanted to make sure that reorient us all to item nine. I appreciate the heads up on items ten and 11. Okay. Well, the court fees called the role in the passage of the amended bill.Verbal. Yes. Whereas I. Lewis. Yes. Morales. Yes. Let's get to I. Peterson.Yes.Excellent. Yes. Council. President Gonzales. I. They didn't save or not oppose.The bill passes as amended and the chair will sign it. Will the clerk fix my signature to the legislation on my behalf? Will the clerk please read the title of item ten into the record?\nSummary:",

Oh, so you two guys great minds. The transportation and traffic is something we hear about all that time in Alameda, in not just Alameda, but the Bay Area and the inner city. See, the vice mayor and Councilmember de SAC, I think, sit on the liaison with AC Transit.But there is an AC transit parcel tax renewal bond measure on this year's ballot. And so we are very fortunate to have our own representative on the AC Transit Board, Elsa Ortiz. Ms. Ortiz And we. We earlier heard a proclamation recognizing National Hispanic Heritage Month.And if I recall correctly, she hails from Colombia. Yes. Anyway, she has served as well on the AC Transit Board for a number of years and Ms.. Ortiz is going to tell you a little bit about this thing you.Thank you. Good evening, Madam Mayor. Some members of the city council. Thank you for allowing me to come before you to ask support for our parcel tax. As you mention, we're not increasing the current $8 that you pay regardless of the size of your house is only $8 per month.Per month. Yes, yes, yes. And so we only extending it for 20 years. Right. It covers expenditures of operations and maintenance. It expires in 2019. And so this is the last time that we have an opportunity to be before the voters in a presidential election.Back in 2012, we thought about going to the ballot, but then measure B B was on the ballot. So we stepped aside in order for B B to pass. We did the same thing in 2014. We stepped aside so that all the cities, including AC Transit and all the transit agencies that benefited could have.Measure B b approved. What we were concerned about was that the arguments that b b would be making would have been the same arguments that we would have made. So that that's when we thought, you know, we stepped aside.So this is the last chance that we have before it expires. It is immense. This is $30 million a year. It means a lot to AC transit. It funds school trips, 30,000 kids today and people to work 43% of our trips.It helps to keeps fares reasonable. Reasonable. I think we have increased fares in the last five years. It funds critical services for seniors and riders with disability, with discounted fares. We also provide discount affairs for kids. We have it requires we have safeguards.We have. And part of the measure, it creates an an advisory and audit process to make sure that we spend the money as what is intended to spend, you know, as you know, funding from state has degrees and from the feds, it can fluctuate.So we become more and more dependent on local measures. We just begun to make a major expansion in service because of measure be. If we were to lose the 20 the $30 million full measure from the parcel tax, it will put us back to 2010, which was beginning to restore service when we have those serious draconian cutsbecause of the recession that everybody went through. We have been indoors this our measure has been endorsed by Congress. One woman, woman barbara lee. But alameda and contra costa labor council. We do surf contra part of contra costa to the alameda county democratic central committee.This is a club like league of women voters and many other. So I do humbly request that you support our parcel tax.Percentage doesn't need to pass.What percentage do you need to pass?Is it 50% or two thirds?Two thirds.This is although two thirds now.They think that all that transit. Proposal required to be.Because if a specific program.Member.Expects to have a quick question, thank you for your presentation so that the 19 is coming back to.Me in December.Can you kind of share the schedule on when that is and the headways and what we can expect?It's going to start the difficult difficulty we have been having and. You know, taking creating this service expansion is we have to hire more drivers. And so that has been delayed a little bit. We're going to start and and then 19.We will start in December. And yeah, this December is that's the second stage. I think that 20 minutes is the is the frequency that we're going to have. We're also working with because remember, we had three alternatives when we were using the measure B, we have that whenever Easter, NC now and others, we are working with thecity to make sure that we get enough funding to then start the line the inside out to the ferry. We're working with the MTC, with AC, DC, with weather and all of you to make sure that we have that kind of money.We also part of our transit plan is to have eventually the BRT running about.What Spirit stand for.Bus rapid transit, which is dedicated lanes. So yeah.And then if somebody is listening that wants to apply, how can they apply to be a bus driver?Go to our website. Yes.Good question. W WW dot.Is the transit thought okay. Yes.And please, let's get this bus to the ferry as soon as we can.Yes. Well, yeah, I mean. You know, every city asks for more service, but we are bound by kind of money.That where your favorite, right?Yes. You know, it is. I work hard at.Substantial cuts the last time, so we should have more service restored.Thank you.Member de SAC.I just want to make sure to say that for the viewing audience for Alameda is watching this, that the AC Transit Board really went out of their way to make sure to take the time to obtain what our suggestion or recommendation was with regard to ultimately what turned out to be funding for the Buena Vista line.They took us special considerations for that. And so I hope Alameda has realize the incredible assistance that Mr. Ortiz had gave him personally, as well as the board generally. And one final note. I mean, I hope the residents also realize that the point that she made about, you know, looking into the busses and improving their their accessto the ferries is an incredible another incredible point. So that when people go to the polls in November that Alameda is overwhelmingly support this.Thank you, Tony. Yeah, I have to, you know, closing remarks. The city of Alameda and AC Transit works really well together. We meet together once every three months for a committee that we have created between the two agencies.We get together, we hear the concerns and what how we can work together. So it is a wonderful relationship that we have.Thank you. We have emotion.I think the vice mayor was fair.I'd like to move that. We support this as a city council.Thank you.Yeah, go ahead.Look, I have a motion and a second. All those in favor.Of.My motion carries unanimously IFP.Okay. And this is my last poll.When I read it.

Councilman said Abarca, will you please put Council Bill 914 on the floor?I move that council bill 914 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.Thank you. It has been moved and seconded. The courtesy hearing for Council Will 914 is open. May we have the staff report?Good evening. My name is Karen. I'm with Landmark Preservation in Community Planning and Development and we are here to talk about the proposed updates to the Landmark Ordinance or chapter 30 of the Denver Revised Municipal Code. Landmark Preservation was established in 1967 by Denver City Council with the purpose of designating, preserving and protecting historic resources.I Council noted at the time that it was the sense of the Council that the economic, cultural and esthetic standing of the city cannot be maintained or enhanced by disregarding the historic architectural and geographical history of the city.The Denver landmarks vary from what you see in the upper left hand corner, which is a staged stop at Four Mile Park to something as modern as a hangar in Stapleton. They vary over what is significant for in the types of buildings that that we have.There are currently 344 individual landmarks and 55 historic districts, which equals about 6800 primary buildings in the city in county of Denver, or approximately out of the approximately 160,000 buildings. 55 historic districts make it seem like a lot, but it's really about 4% of the city.And through this process, as we were looking at other peer cities, we found that that's an approximate number of percentage of buildings that are designated for cities of our size. So for the proposed landmark ordinance, we convened a task force of 16 members.It was intentionally put together to include those who were supportive of preservation, those who are not supportive of preservation, and those who were neutral. It included residents from a variety of different neighborhoods around the city and professions that intersected with landmark preservation, including to members of council developers, architects, realtors and contractors.We also looked at putting, when we convene the task force to have people who are newer residents to Denver, as well as people who had lived here for a long time and those who are multi-generation families from Denver.So we got to do a diverse group of people who had lived in the city and county of Denver. They they met for a yearlong process and convened 11 different facilitated stakeholder meetings. During their initial two meetings, the task force did a problem identification and they looked at what were the area, what were the areas that theywanted to focus on. They talked about a lack of diversity in the designated prop properties. The complexity of the ordinance requirements. Conflict associated with designations submitted as part of the demolition process. And the lack of incentives for designation.So the goals and the recommendations that are being put forth addressed is each of these items that were identified in the task force. The task force looked at those problem statements as well as criteria that they established sorry, as well as criteria that they established to determine if they were successful, that the processes that were being updatedwere clear and predictable, that they were consistent with long held citywide practices and that they were based on best preservation practices. We as staff conducted a nationwide comparative analysis of 12 peer cities, and when we talked to them, we looked at standard preservation practices, best practices, innovative programs, and then we called and talked to them to findout what were things that didn't work. We didn't want to put forward ideas that they found didn't work. And after the 11 meetings and the other 12 month process, the task force reached a consensus on all of the recommendations that are put forward.And so one of our one of our last meetings, one of our task force members said that he was a little bit uncomfortable with this. And then he looked and said, but he thinks any Levinsky, who is the director of historic Denver, was also a little bit uncomfortable, which probably meant that we hit the right balance betweenmaking things. That was a good compromise. So the recommendations are to add a culture criteria to our designation criteria. So the task force is recommending to add three criteria to our culture, one on how the site was used by past generations.Could a site or property be a source of pride or cultural understanding to a community? And three, is it associated with social movements, institutions, or patterns of growth or change in the community? We looked at what would be the right number of criteria, and we expanded our 12 peer cities to 32 cities.We looked at other Colorado cities. We especially looked at two cities in Colorado that had paid professional staff of at least two members. There aren't any other comparable cities in Colorado to Denver, but we wanted to choose cities that were actually putting some resources towards preservation.As an understanding that that's an ethos of that city. So we looked at Boulder and Fort Collins. Then we also looked at other peer cities like Austin, Portland and Seattle. And we found a variety of ways of how people were how many criteria were needed in order to be a landmark in those cities.And we looked at it, and most of those cities had a list of criteria rather than the categories that we currently have. Only ourselves, Boise, Boise and Greeley, out of the 32 cities, had categories. So the task force is recommending to remove the categories and have criteria.So here are existing designation criteria of history, architecture and geography. And so the task force is recommending to remove the categories and then create a list of criteria that include culture. And as you can see here, there's a list of ten criteria.They are still associated with the categories, with the addition of culture, and that it would meet a designation would meet three out of the ten in order to be designated. That is still one of the highest thresholds in the nation.As we looked at some of those same 32 cities, 24 of them, or 75% require fewer than 30% criteria met to be a landmark or a designation in their city. So we're still maintaining a high requirement for designation, which was an important part of what the task force talked about.We also went and looked and tried different properties against the proposed criteria. This is the Macedonia Baptist Church. It's listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but it is not a Denver landmark. So there was research that was already associated with this property.And when we looked at it, we found that it would have been significant under the proposed criteria under architecture, as well as under two, under culture as a source of pride, as well as associated with social movements or institutions of pattern and growth.And so we found that this criteria worked for the culture criteria to allow for designated properties that represent the African-American community. We also looked at iconic buildings, things that are already designated and whether they still be designated today.So we took one of the most iconic buildings in Denver, which is Union Station, and found that it would meet six out of the ten criteria and would still be eligible under the proposed criteria. We also wanted to look at residential in addition to in addition to commercial properties.And so we looked at the Molly Brown house, which is one of the more iconic residential buildings in Denver, and found that it still met the criteria three out of ten and felt like that would be a good threshold number.And then we also looked at a property that we had reviewed for a demolition permit a couple of years ago. And at that time, we found that it didn't meet the existing criteria and categories that we have. And we found under the proposed new criteria, it would still would not meet the it would still not meet thecriteria to would only be significant under architecture. And so we wanted to try out the proposed criteria under different for different properties and under different methods to ensure that we were reaching the right balance in the task force found that the three out of ten would be the appropriate criteria for designation.The other reason that the task force was primarily convened was to look at the conflicts that comes from properties that are come under demolition review and then a designation process is started through that. And so we talked extensively about ways to reduce the conflict in that we wanted to provide some numbers of the of what we havereviewed citywide. So if you can see the blue graph bar on the the largest numbers are the properties that landmark staff reviewed and approved for demolition. Then the much smaller purple shows the number of properties that we found had the potential to be a Denver landmark, and those were posted.And then the very small that you almost can't see the line, but you can see the number are the number of designations that were received from 2014 through midyear of 2019. And so we're talking about a really small percentage of properties that come forward, but understanding that when they do come forward, there is a lot of conflictthat is associated with that. So of those designations that came forward, only one has been designated as a landmark. It's the Beth Eden Baptist Church, which was designated in 2014 or 2015. We have had three that were withdrawn by the applicant, three that were denied by city council.And then we have two that were denied by the Landmark Preservation Commission because they found that the applications were not sufficient to come forward. These owner opposed designations are very rare. And one of the things that we found in Denver and in our research with our peer cities is that we sometimes find a really good way ofsaving buildings that aren't necessarily through designation. And so while only one property has been designated through this process, we've also we've saved a variety of buildings through a compromise that didn't come through designation. And the task force talked about wanting to take this process out of the binary demo or designation process and turn it into some sortof collaboration between the community and the property owner. And so the task force is proposing to add a pause in the process. So the top line shows the current process that that a designation would go forward and a demolition review.And on the top one in green, it shows that there's a short seven day pause. What the task force is talking about doing is extending that pause from seven days to 39 days, which adds up to a grand total of a 60 day pause.Within that pause, there would be a required third party facilitated meeting, and it would be facilitated by a city paid facilitator. Landmark staff would who would attend these meetings to help provide information that would be needed. But the intent is to bring the property owner or any of the property owners, representatives together with community members, with membersof the R.A., and bring in any outside expertize that could be needed on the cases that have come forward to city council. We have. On that. Sometimes you have asked questions about the stability of the property or was there a compromise that could be reached in this process?It would allow for bringing in outside experts who are structural engineers, who are used to working on historic properties, and that they could also provide input in this process if needed. One of the questions that we got in our public comment period is what happens if someone decides to skip the third party facilitated meeting?And so we address this by if the person who asked for the pause or submitted the notice of intent. If they don't attend the facilitated meeting, that demolition would automatically be approved the next business day. If the property owner or the property owners representatives do not attend the meeting, then the demolition is automatically denied.The next day the property owner would have the ability to start the process over again, but they would have to restart from the beginning. And so there's a reaction on either side if they don't attend the facilitated meeting.So those are the two major changes that are proposed in the landmark ordinance. There are a variety of smaller updates. The landmark ordinance has been updated about 20 some times in the last 52 years, and no one has gone through and looked for consistency within the ordinance.So we are clarifying, removing and streamlining some processes. The Internet was not in existence at the time we wrote this in 1967. So we've updated the email on the Internet existing. There are other ways to communicate versus just mail.We clarified how a few things were done. We have added or amended definitions, including temporary structures for which landmark preservation would not review temporary signage or structures. We have also added something to help provide consistency with other CPD boards and to to manage the agendas of boards.If someone submits a does or submits a design review application, they are taken in a first come, first serve basis. Based on if your application is complete, there are also recommendations to update the Lower Downtown Design Review Board.Changing the name from a board to a commission and adding two At-Large members. One of the other things we did for consistency is that both the Landmark Preservation Commission and the Lower Downtown Design Review Board perform design review in a very similar manner.But the ordinance does not talk about it in the same way. So we're just clarifying and making sure that the ordinance discusses their review process in the same manner. We are also proposing a few items that are not in the ordinance but were things that the Land Preservation Office is working on.The first is to provide clarity for proposed historic districts. So we're formalizing a process for city led community meetings on proposed historic districts. We have staff attend the community meetings that are put forward by the applicants at this time.We attend multiple meetings frequently, but there was a talk, especially from some of the neighborhood residents on the task force, about wanting additional time for communities that are going through a proposed designation. And so we would, once they complete application, would be submitted into landmark staff, we would send a letter along with an FAA cue to everyonewho lives within the historic district or owns property in the district, and tell them that there is going to be a meeting in 30 days to allow the community time to talk about the process. Landmark staff would provide information, and then it's mainly intended to be a Q&A for members of the community to ask Landmarks staff whatmeet what it means to be a historic district. Once that meeting has taken place, we would start an online system to help map and track comments. We currently have a system of dueling petitions where people who are supportive sign a petition and people who are not as supportive or opposed sign a petition.And at the last large historic district that came forward, there were people who signed both petitions which made it difficult for us to provide information to you guys as to what was the community support for this. So this would be an online mapping system.It's the same system that we used to get comments for Blueprint. Denver So it would move away from neighbors going binary yes or no for neighbors, but that they could come and provide their comments online, that they would drop a pen as to where they are, that they would provide their contact information and address so that wecould verify that they are actually the people who are filling out the survey and that they would have an area for free comment for anything that they wanted to provide written comment to us. This can also have the advantage of being able to be put in multiple languages to provide better access to it.We also wanted to continue to take comment from people who don't own computers or don't have access to the Internet. They can still call us. They can come in person, they can write a letter, they can email us.So we aren't precluding any other form of comment. But we wanted to make sure that we had an opportunity to help streamline the process a little bit. One of the things the task force also talked about is to explore ways to incentivize designation.We did not find a silver bullet or a magic pot of money somewhere, but we did find through our research that other cities have additional zoning incentives that we don't have or that we aren't using to the best that could be enhanced.And so we're looking to do zoning tools to encourage designation things like administrative adjustments or variances for recommendations. If the property and the changes that they're meeting making would be compatible with the character so as to reduce the barriers for people who are designated.And this is just a summary of some of the proposed updates that are outside of the ordinance, but that are things that we at Landmark Preservation are working on after the discussion with the task force. We had an extensive community outreach.We had a variety of meetings before the Landmark Preservation Commission, the Lower Downtown Design Review Board, Planning Board. We went and met with ANC a couple of times. We had community meetings that were out in the community as well as office hours, and then we had meetings that were one on one meetings with people, as well asmeetings with organizations for the Denver Metro Association of Realtors Air. We met with Arnaud's when they requested it. We had a public comment period on the draft that was about a two month period, and we incorporated those comments into the final version.Into the final version before you. Oh, sorry. Public comments. We received 11 public comments from people during the draft period. And then on the final red line, we received comments, we received 16 emails. That was a form email that was in support of the proposed amendment that was not brought forward.And then we received two letters from one from History, Colorado and one from the Colorado preservation ink in support of this, as well as 13 letters submitted by individuals who were in support of this. And so the recommendations are to add culture and simplify the criteria that remove the categories and add three criteria for the demolition reviewprocess to extend the demolition review process and to add a required third party facilitation meeting to encourage collaboration and then a variety of changes for clarity and consistency. If this is approved, it would have an effective date of November 1st.However, any designation applications that are submitted by October 31st would be processed under the existing criteria. So there are a few designations that are in process right now that you guys would see under the old criteria. And anything that's submitted up through October 31st would be under the old criteria.And I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.Thank you very much. We have nine, I think.That's nine people and everybody, if I'm reading this right, I think all nine in support tonight who are speaking, signed up to speak tonight. So I'm going to call the first five up. If you can come up to this first bench and then just step up.When I call your name, you'll have your 3 minutes start on the clock. Sheron not only Carla McConnell, Annie Levinsky, Rosemary Stoffel and Barbara Paul if you could come up and Sharon Nunnally, you are up first.Good evening, council members. My name is Sharon Nunnally. I live in Denver, Colorado, in the Humboldt Park Historic District. I am a past chair of the Denver Landmark Preservation Commission. When we had no design guidelines and our process pretty much was we would try to meet people as much as possible halfway.I am also the author of the Five Points Historic District, Cultural, Historic District. And that particular district speaks to what did not exist at the time that I wrote that application. It was written in 2000, 2001, and final designation was in 2002.And at that time, Jennifer Moulton was the director of planning and Wellington Webb was the mayor. And I think the only person on council at that time was Debbie Ortega, and that is still, still with us. So at the time that we proposed that application, the ordinance is was in its current state.There was no such thing quite as cultural. The word was used, but there had never, ever been an application brought forth on the basis of culture or quite frankly, on the basis of history of a people and a geographic location.So it took a lot of rereading on my part. Even though I had read that ordinance 100 times, I read it another 50 just to see how I could cause this application to take form in the current ordinance language.And it was very tricky, but we managed to get it done. After much explaining and many community meetings and people, everybody on both sides of the discussion were very confused. What do you mean? And why is it this place?And what about these buildings? There are only seven contributing buildings in that district, and so that was intentional and it was a way to recognize the most important buildings, because we also had a landscape that had a lot of add ons.However, the main piece of the application was about the district itself, the people, the business corridor at a time that we don't hope to ever repeat in history. And it was during the period of segregation total in this country from the twenties to the fifties.And we worked on helping people understand the process from beginning to the time of them.I'm sorry, but your 3 minutes are up.Oh, I'm sorry. Well, thank you very much. Anyway, that's where we started.Thank you, Carla McConnell.Good evening. My name is Carla McConnell. I live at 662 Ulster Way, which is in Lowry. I've been involved in historic preservation, both as a volunteer serving on the Denver Landmarks Commission, as a trustee for historic Denver and on the Colorado Preservation Board and professionally as an architect with the National Park Service.Tonight, I ask that you adopt the proposed revisions to our landmark ordinance. Denver's ordinance has resulted in the preservation of over 300 individual landmarks and predictable changes in our 55 historic districts. Our community has benefited from creative developers who have adaptively reused non-designated properties.But the strength of our landmark ordinance is in saving many qualifying properties, which may have been viewed as disposable. Earlier this evening, Lowry's 25th anniversary was celebrated. Thank you. Lowry is a great reminder of the value of proactive preservation planning at Lowry.Buildings that were first seen as white elephants, such as hangars one and two were protected before development began in a landmark district and are now centerpieces of the community. Affordable housing went into the Grand Lowry Lofts and many other examples of adaptive reuse on the one time base gives our neighborhood its unique character.LOWRY Success required collaboration between the city, the master developer and neighboring residents. In the 1990s, the certainty that grounded these decisions could not have been achieved without the tools provided by the landmark ordinance. These proposed updates ensure that we can continue to preserve places that tell Denver's story while attracting investment and meeting community needs.I thank Councilmembers Flynn and Ken each for their active involvement in the updating process for the time commitment of committee volunteers and especially wish to acknowledge the leadership of Denver's landmark staff. The staff both assembled a committee reflecting various points of view, extensively researched best practices from cities with equivalent preservation programs, and managed to end the processwith a consensus vote of approval from the committee. No small achievement. Again, the proposed revisions to the landmark ordinance are worthy of your adoption this evening. Thank you.Thank you. Next up, any levinsky.Thank you. I'm Annie Levinsky, executive director of Historic Denver, Inc, a local nonprofit membership supported organization. I served as a member of the task force over the past 18 months, and we, as historic Denver, came to the table because we agreed that there was room to improve some of the landmark processes and specifically those processes related tohow new historic designations come forward. I'll admit we were also a little trepidatious about what this might look like and what the outcomes would be. That said, everyone on the task force approached the issues thoughtfully and openly, and the city staff provided helpful research on how other cities were either successfully or not successfully handling similar challenges.In the end, the task force everyone on the task force did make compromises. I don't think everyone left the room getting everything they wanted, but we did leave the room in agreement that we had come to a place where the recommendations were solid, where they would serve our community well, and where they would resolve the core issuesthat we were commissioned to address. So I want to thank the other task force members, a number of whom are here tonight, because it was a really major time commitment. The two major recommendations of the task force relate to the designation criteria, which you've heard and the designations that result from the demolition review process, which are veryrare when the property owners do not support them. We're very excited about the inclusion of the cultural criteria in the designation. We think they can help reduce bias inherent in the system and help invite recognition of resources that reflect the full range of Denver's history.And we look forward to building relationships in the communities all across the city to understand what places are meaningful to them as we get used to these new criteria. Often there have been a number of sites that have been underrepresented in formal preservation programs, and Sharon highlighted one of the challenges she faced 20 years ago trying toprotect the Five Points District. But we also know that we needed to maintain a high bar for designation. And so I'll move to the three criteria on the designations that are more contentious, that do not have the support of property owners, which I think Carol highlighted.But it's less than 0.01% of all of the demolitions that come through. But still, we know that they raise contention. And we also know from our own experience that taking a little time to explore alternatives when those issues arrive can often lead to the win win outcome.And really, the value is not so much in the designation itself, but in the dialog that is generated by having the opportunity to engage. So we believe that the new structure for demolition postings, which really refocuses the time on dialog and mediation, will provide a better path toward resolution with either even fewer of those coming forward tothis body. We do look forward to working on some of the incentives that the task force was not able to address because they're not in the ordinance and upholding the preservation legacy in Denver, which has saved places from the mine to LoDo, the Paramount to First Unitarian Church.Thank you for your consideration.Thank you. Next up, Rosemary Stoffel.My name is Rosemary Stoffel and I live at 2275 South Monroe Street. My role on the Landmark Ordinance Task Force was as a community representative. I've been an advocate for preservation in my own neighborhood as well as in the city as a former historic Denver board member.Other task force members represented different points of view, and not everyone was always on the same page.But each of us did have the opportunity to speak up.We all had to compromise on some things, but in the end agree that we were all on board with the final recommendations. The process involved many hours of meetings and also reading a lot of information sent out by landmark staff before each meeting.Please respect the.Work of the task.Force and adopt these recommendations tonight without any changes or delays. I want to emphasize the importance.Of the pause period.For owner opposed designations in older, older neighborhoods like mine. We have lost many older homes in recent years, including two which were important enough.To be posted by the.City as potentially eligible for designation. One of these was an architectural treasure known to most of us in the neighborhood, an intact Queen Anne House, which had one of favorite Old House award in 2009. The new owner had applied for a demolition permit and was planning to scrape the house in order to build a brand new home. I talked to this owner over the phone several times about considering ways that.He could both.Save the house and get the kind of home he wanted.But the tight.Deadline in the demo review process made that difficult. We never.Met face to.Face or had the.Time or.Expertize available to look at possibilities other.Than designation, other than demolition or designation. Sitting down together with a neutral facilitator, with city staff available to provide facts and other experts. We would have been would have been much more neighborly and given us a better chance to hear each other's perspectives.I don't know if the outcome would have been any different in this particular case, but a longer timeline would also have provided due respect to one of our neighborhoods important assets.Please adopt this proposed.Ordinance tonight so these updates can happen sooner rather than later. Thank you.Thank you, Barbara Paul and then Mark Bowman, Amy Cole, Dennis Humphries and Gregorio Al Caro. If you want to come up to the front bench, go ahead.Thank you. My name is Barbara Paul, and I'm the senior vice president.For Preservation Field.Services for the National Trust for Historic Preservation. I work for the National Trust for 35 years, all the while residing here in Denver. I have been proud to have worked with the city, historic Denver and local property owners on the designation of the Lower Downtown Historic District in the 1980s and the downtown Historic District in 2001.Big, bold projects like these have demonstrated Denver's leadership in the field of historic preservation, leadership in particular that has benefited from the city's elected officials. As a result, as you've already heard, 300 individual landmarks and 50 stark neighborhoods, but that still only represents 4% of the city's built environment.But yet we.Are here to applaud your outcomes that.Will make it easier for Denver's diverse and culturally rich historic sites and neighborhoods to be considered for local landmark designation that will allow more time for property owners and community members to meet and consider alternatives to potential demolition.That is the forever loss of an historic property.And that will ease regulatory.Barriers and create greater flexibility for owners who want to protect their historically designated property. These changes represent best practices the National Trust has been promoting in other cities across the country, including in Miami, where we've been working with the city to protect the culture rich Little Havana neighborhood that was threatened by up zoning.And in Philadelphia, the cradle of America, where now the mayor's.Task force has included the creation of a new fund.To create incentives to encourage underserved communities to engage in the preservation of their neighborhoods. My colleague Jim Lindberg, who also is here in Denver in our office, recently sent you a letter in support of this bill, and he wrote the Landmark Protection Ordinance that has helped Denver achieve its reputation as one of America's most vibrant, livable andattractive cities, to which I would also add, culturally diverse. So as a preservation professional and a citizen of this city, I urge you to vote in favor of this bill.Thank you. Next up, Mark Bowman.Good evening, President Clark, members of council, thank you for your time and consideration. My name is Mark Bowman. I'm here on behalf of DeMar Denver, Metro Boss Board of Realtors, the largest realtor association in Colorado, representing 7200 plus members.In addition to a member of DeMar, I'm a contractor and a realtor that have worked on historic homes for over 45 years. I'm also an Air Force veteran and a Lowry graduate. I'm here to express our support for the amendment package that is before you this evening.I had the opportunity to serve on the Landmark Preservation Task Force and attended each and every meeting and had that we had over 18 months before devolving. Delving into my comments, I'd like to thank staff and fellow task force members for all their hard work and time they possessed.Dee Myers, in a support of the package, was filed for the following reasons. First, we are hopeful that the pause period will provide non owner applicants and property owners the additional time and dialog prior to application going to LPC or City Council.Second, we support simplifying the designation criteria and adding culture, which is an important criteria to consider and designation process. Finally, we appreciate small language modifications that make it clear to council in giving consideration to property owners position when facing owner post designation.One of my favorite expressions is all the best agreements are reached when everybody is a little bit uncomfortable and I think everyone will agree that we were all a little uncomfortable but came to a consensus on this proposal.With that said, in light of three recent and one still unresolved owner opposed designations, it's no secret that we would like additional provisions for property owners facing unwanted landmark designations. And to be clear, to correct the record for something that was said in committee.It is not DeMarco's position to oppose landmark designation. On the contrary, we believe landmark designation has an important part of shaping our city, is a tool, has been used appropriately to save some of the city's most venerated buildings and coveted neighborhoods such as the Mayan Theater and Curtis Park.Three years ago, some of you called for Chapter 30 update for two main reasons. One, you wanted to end the ugly owner oppose landmark in front of city council. And two, you wanted to see additional provisions for property owners that had their backs against the wall that were that had to be very lopsided process.Unfortunately, this process missed the mark and accomplishing the second goal. We'd like to thank Councilmembers Black and Gilmore for bringing forward their amendments, especially the amendment proposed raising the bar for owner post designation. And even though that is not a part of this consideration, we would like serious consideration for this moving forward.I'm sorry, but your time is up. Thank you. Thank you. Amy, call.Good evening, members of Council. My name is Amy Cole and I'm a 20 year resident of West Highlands. I live on 29th Avenue. In March of 2018, I was asked to serve on the Landmark Ordinance Task Force as a neighborhood resident.And over the course of 18 months, I attended all but one of the meetings and was an active participant, including providing regular reports to my R.A., the West Highlands Neighborhood Association. Our work focused on ways to encourage dialog between the city community members and property owners during the landmark designation process, the clarification of ordinance, language and reviewingthe kinds of historic significance a property should have in order to be considered for designation. Following outreach to the community about these proposed changes, the task force work concluded in June 2019 and represents the collective effort of 14 Volunteer Task Force Members, Council Persons Flynn and Ken each and was supported by Mike Hughes and the landmark andCPD staff. Our task force reached consensus about the proposal before you tonight and agree, and the agreement of the group was that it be submitted to council without amendment. Therefore, I ask you to please vote in favor of the ordinance package as it's been submitted.Thanks for your consideration.Thank you. Dennis Humphries.Good evening. I'm Dennis Humphries live at 10th and Cherokee in Denver. I'm an architect. I was a member of the task force. And I'm also here to support the revisions to the ordinance as as proposed by the task force.As everybody has stated, it was a lively group and of bringing different opinions to the table, and it was one that was resoundingly of great success. It was the chair of the Landmark Preservation Committee Commission. When a young student from the University of Colorado at Boulder came and tried to designate the Gates property.At that point, we felt as though the commission did their work in skillfully navigating and overwriting that designation. Since that time, the ordinance has been revised, and as with any ordinance, it's always up for need for further revisions.So again, I support the revisions for all the reasons that all the other members of the task force have stated. However, I would like to point out that it has been addressed, that there are several incentives that need to be addressed that are not part of this ordinance and would not be part of the Landmark Preservation Ordinance. And those are incentives to encourage people to want to preserve their properties, whether it be through tax benefits or other financial benefits. We need to work beyond this moment to make sure that those happen. We also need to further fund the Discover Denver program that has been ongoing for five years.This program has been predominantly financed by the state. It's the city's responsibility to push this forward. The purpose of this program is to inform and allow property owners to really know the value in the potential historic value of their property.So I would encourage you as a as a board, a council, to make sure that these initiatives, these incentives are pursued aggressively after this ordinance is passed. So as an architect, I believe one of my favorite sayings is that in the end, our society will not be defined by what we create.But but why we but what we refuse to destroy. So I encourage you this evening to support this ordinance. Thank you very much.Thank you. Gregorio Al Caro.Thank you. Members of City Council. I'm a Denver native. I represent a house called Casa Mayan at 10/29 Street and Tampa on the Aurora campus. I'm also an urban designer. I ask for your support in particularly the use of the word culture to be added to the updates.I particularly want to focus on social movements and culture as an example to better understand spaces through its social evolution. The Denver Landmark Commission in 1967 did not have the word culture they were use. They did hint, though, that buildings should not be frozen in time, that they needed to remain active.They needed to have a link to a memorable events. Using the word culture will prove successful, as I will give a successful case study with customer, an historic house in Denver, ninth Street Historic Park. We had a migration of many Mexican-Americans during the Mexican Revolution until the 1970s, a house that turned into a mutual aid society.It was a non religious non-governmental house that became a mutual ista mutual aid society. This house proved to be very important in understanding the Mexican-Americans and Irish-Americans importance of having spaces to preserve their culture. Music. Dance, food. Political gatherings.People like Betty and Vernita slaughtered. They had ETA. Richard de Castro found a place in a home to preserve their culture and engage in political discussions that would lead to the preservation of the alma Lincoln Park in the Chicano movement.In 40 years since the displacement, that house has been used for storage, for offices. But by using the word culture and bringing back a cultural narrative, that house has been brought back to life. Political discussions, cultural movements, historic design conferences.Culture is very critical. The students and the community bring life and spirit back to this house. This is not only an important tool for planners. Architects. Urban designers. Landscape architects. Public artist. It welcomes those to our country that have a particular heritage.They feel grounded when they know that cultural heritage, they feel welcome. And more importantly, they have a freedom to express their culture. This is a great design tool. It will lead to better urban design. Less divisiveness. And I strongly urge you to support.This amendment or this addition update. Good questions.Could you state your name for the record?Gregorio Alcala.Thank you very much. All right. That does conclude our speakers this evening. Are there any questions from members of council clementines?Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. It's better when the microphones on. We have a ask a question about the Molly Brown house. From I. It doesn't matter that. Yeah. The question that I have is it looks like based on the presentation, three out of the current ten criteria are tied to the Molly Brown House meetsthree of the ten criteria, and we're moving from a 67% threshold to a 30% threshold. The Molly Brown House is a historic lead designated building now, correct?Yes. Correct. Historic. Never owns the Molly Brown house so I can speak definitively. Answer yep.So. But it also somehow met the 67% criteria threshold and now it meets only 30%. I guess that's that's that's my confusion.Yeah. We, I think spent maybe two whole task force meetings sort of trying to figure out this math piece around how do you maintain a high bar? Because it's not exactly apples to apples, because right now we require properties to meet at least two criteria out of three categories.And so that's where you get the 67 strip the categories. Then you could say it's 20% and we're going up to 30. So it's just essentially a different system. But as you saw, still maintains a pretty high bar.Okay. I was thinking I was pretty good with math, but that just wasn't enough for me. So thank you. That's that's all ahead. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Gilmore.Thank you, President. Clerk Cara, can I ask you a couple questions, please? Um, let me see. On the task force. Slide slide seven. Um, could you give us a breakdown of the task force makeup specifically around race and then the area of the city that folks lived in?Yes. So it was a primarily white task force. There were two Latina women, one of whom did not attend as regularly as as the other task force members. We it was a very technical task force. And so in preservation as a field, as well as the architects, realtors and developers is a primarily white field.We did attempt to diversify the task force on Councilwoman Can. Each provided us with some good contacts. We reached out and asked members to join the task force. They initially said yes and then after a couple of meetings of not attending, when we got back in touch with them and they said that no, they didn't feel likethe task force intersected enough with their work or areas that they were working on in order to be able to attend. So it is admittedly a pretty white task force in terms of where people lived. We didn't check the addresses of everyone, but we did try to make sure that the neighborhoods, the representatives of the neighborhood werespread out. So we had someone on the West, someone from the south, and then we had two neighborhood representatives from the Park Hill area.Okay. Thank you. So you weren't able to get any residents, I guess, further east of Park Hill?No, there were no none of the neighborhood residents were. No. We did ask people to of the people that we asked, we asked someone who represented the little area in Swansea, a neighborhoods. And then someone from more the Montebello area.And those were the people who said initially said yes and then said no, that this really didn't meet the the needs of what they were working on.And so I guess the technical nature of the task force and what you were reviewing, I guess, for the four neighborhood residents that served on the task force. How did you get them versus other neighborhood individuals?We looked for people who had so so two of the neighbors from Park Hill where people who had lived in the proposed historic district that had been proposed for Park Hill, and they were two neighbors who were not supportive of preservation.And we really wanted to make sure that we got people who were familiar somewhat with the historic districts or the landmark processes. So it was one of the things we looked at. We were looking at people who were either supportive or not supportive.We wanted someone who was familiar with preservation to a little bit of a degree. And so we chose the two or we asked the two people from the Park Hill neighborhood two to come as residents who had gone through the process or started to go through the district process.So we chose or asked those two members to join, and then we asked for two other neighborhood residents who were more supportive of preservation and trying to make sure that they were from other, other neighborhoods. And we wanted to make sure that they were from different parts of the city.So would it be a true statement then that out of the 16 members on the task force, you didn't have at least neighborhood representation that was maybe against.LAMB We had to, yeah, that the two neighbors from Park Hill were not supportive of protesters in.Support of gender neutral. Okay.Not supportive or neutral? Sorry. Not.That's okay. All right. And then I guess it sounds like early on in the process then, since you were trying to backfill with additional task force members, did you ever reach out to the council officers? We asked them to recommend people or through our registered neighborhood organizations, faith based organizations, nonprofit organizations, to ask us for recommendations.We did not. We spoke with Councilwoman Kennedy, but we did not reach out to the other council district offices.Okay. And then on further in your slide deck, the community meetings that you held, as close as I can see, it looks like that would be open to the public. There were four of them that weren't, you know, kind of hosted by a different group.Were any of your community meetings held in the Montebello or Green Valley Ranch neighborhoods?No, they were not. We had one on the West Side. We had one in Virginia Village, we had one in. We did office hours in the Blair Caldwell Library. And there's a fourth one. And I'm sorry, I'm forgetting where that one was, but none and.MONDELLO No.Okay. Or North Green Valley Ranch? No. Okay. And then with the task force, I guess, where did the conversation go? Or around the process, especially in the importance of perhaps reaching out to vulnerable neighborhoods that are at risk of gentrification or involuntary displacement?I guess where did the task force go with that conversation? And yeah, where did they go with that conversation?We had some conversations about displacement, but we also talked about it was one of the things that was brought up in problem identification and then it was scaled back because we only represent landmark is 4% of the city and that wasn't we did not feel it was something that the landmark ordinance could take on.That displacement is a huge issue within the city and was not necessarily something that landmark preservation could solve. It was something that was brought up and discussed, but it was determined that the landmark ordinance maybe wasn't the place to have that full discussion.So there was. So it sounded like there was maybe never a conversation around looking at large parcels of land in neighborhoods that are mainly African-American and Latino and possibly vulnerable. But there was never an overlay or further in-depth conversation around if there was a landmarking of, say, for example, a church property that now you're the different criteria, opens it up to more availability for it to be landmarked. But there was never really a back and forth conversation of how might that affect equity in the neighborhood? How might that encourage, you know, just I guess, distrust, unrest when there might be especially around an owner opposed designation and especially let me add on to that.If that owner opposed designation was possibly a group of Caucasian residents that were trying to landmark perhaps an African-American or Latino property. Was that specific scenario played out, talked about how can we get to a win win solution?A That particular scenario was not talked about in the incentives discussion. We talked about adding are there ways to add density to traditionally one unit or to unit to unit zone districts and ways to if something is designated, could you add density to that neighborhood then or to that to that with that building that if someone designatesthe building, then you could increase the number of units that could be in the property. So an ability to add density to neighborhoods. But we didn't talk specifically about places of worship or churches in the task force or discussed the exact scenario that you had asked about.Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you, President Park.Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you, Mr. President. Let me see who I need to ask this question. I wanted to inquire about the increase in the zoning incentives here, and maybe you can help me out here in terms of what what those might entail.So we looked at what other cities were doing and we looked at like. What Portland was doing and talking a little bit about adding density to a one or two unit zone districts, so increasing density that way. We talked about blueprint Denver has talked about you know is encouraging to use throughout the city are beginning to havethat conversation. So we talked about would 80 use be allowed in any historic districts or individual landmarks? Could that sort of be the first place to add on to to add density and allow an incentive for designation? So that was one of the other areas we talked about.We also looked at there are other cities for lower parking requirements to allow administrative adjustments or administrative ah, variances for things like set back, open space, things like that. Those were sort of the zoning areas that we saw that other cities were doing.Some other cities did things like, if you're a landmark and you're going through the permitting process, some of your fees are waived through the building and zoning process. There are a few areas like that that we looked at as well.Okay. That's that's all very helpful. So when you talked about the parcel, it is really just if if your property is large enough to attach an additional unit on the property, maybe not necessarily attached to the structure. None of those include tweaks to the actual building, correct.Yeah. I mean, you could you currently can have what are either administrative adjustments for things like height or a bulk plane, or you can have variances that go to Board of Adjustment. And we currently recommend administrative adjustments or variances if the changes to the property would be something that would be compatible with the character of the building. So additions, something like if you have a gable house like a queen in and you wanted to use the attic space, and the way to do that would be to add some sort of gable or dormers on the side.You would pierce the bulk plane, but that you could get an adjustment for that. And so it would maintain the character of the building, but allow additional use within the building as well.Okay. So any I want to have you come up and just ask you kind of a follow up question. I know having worked on the old courthouse building at Colfax and Kellman, when the development team was looking at making a change to the staircase on the inside.So it wasn't even tinkering with the outside of the building because they were trying to secure some state historic funds. They couldn't do that otherwise. They had to forgo utilizing those resources. So how much do some of these tweaks impact a property owners ability to then access some of the state funding that might be available?Right. So the expectations and the regulations of the state historical fund or the National Park Service for folks using tax credits are are different than the local standards because in Denver we don't Landmark's does not review interior changes.You can get some relief and we've had this happen with local landmarks. If your historic railing isn't quite the right height, you can get some adjustments. And and we're talking about the task force to talk about other ways to remove barriers to adaptive reuse, things like that that can become investment hurdles that folks can't get over asthey're trying to change the use of a building. So we think there is more that can be done to add flexibility. And then owners will have to make the decision about whether that added flexibility outweighs the the federal or the state incentive that they might get in a different manner.But yeah, so that both are sort of separate things. And in terms of the idea around sort of adding density to historic landmarks, we have some examples of that. There's a church on Sixth Avenue where the church was converted into residential and then a row of condos was built behind it on their adjacent land.And so we talked about ways that you could facilitate those kinds of solutions.Holy Ghost.Church. Right. Really creative.While you're there, let me ask one last question. Dennis brought up an issue, Dennis Humphries, about Discover Denver. Do you have any idea how what percentage of of completeness we're at on that project? I don't know, Carol. Maybe that's something for you to answer.But if you have the information, that would be helpful since you're up there.I think Kara and I were just comparing our notes here. I believe it is somewhere between 15 and 18% of the city that has been completed in the first five years. So there's a long way to go still.And that's among those that are still left.Among the what?Among those properties that are still left, because some of those that may have been surveyed might not exist anymore.That's true. Since we started discovered Denver, there have been 3000 demolitions in the city. So. Yeah. Okay.Thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Flynn.Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to. I buzzed in when Councilman Hines was talking about math, and I think Kara might know what I'm going to bring out here in my in my questioning of her. But on the chart where we we are one of the toughest to meet, two out of three criteria.I think Kara will will recall that at each task force meeting, I pointed out that that was not exactly true. It was two out of ten criteria. It's just that we group the ten criteria into three categories. And of the two criteria, you must meet.At a minimum, they must be in two of the three categories. So what the task force did and Kara, could you stand at the mic so that this appears to be a question rather than a comment? Thank you.What what we ended up doing on the task force was we just eliminated categories. But because of that, because it might be very simple to meet to if I can pull up the code, it would be very simple for a property to meet two criteria in any one category direct association with historic event and direct association tothe person who had influence on a society. So in order to not lower the bar by eliminating the categories, that my recollection is what led us to say you need to be three criteria. But they could all still be in what used to be the same category.Correct?That is correct.And then adding, we added culture. And in doing that, in order to maintain the ten categories and not expand it to 12 or 14, we edited it. We did a lot of wordsmithing and we edited some of the create the existing criteria that appear to maybe have a lot of similarities and we would combine them into justone. So overall, by doing away with criteria, we're going from 20% to 30%, not from 67% to 30%.If you could, you could do the math that way.Yes. Thank you. And that was for Councilman Hines at the end. Thank you.Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman CdeBaca.Thank you, Mr. President. I see a representative from the Colorado Latino Forum here wondering. I didn't see you on the list, but would you be willing to come up and speak? Thank you. Yes. So I am curious about the Latino Forum's involvement or your understanding of how this change impacts the ability of diverse communities to either stayin place, stay in communities, or impact preservation themselves.Sure, I think.Of the people on TV. My name is Ian Thomas Tafoya, and this topic actually intersects along three groups that I'm involved with I.N.S. Zoning and Planning, the Colorado Latino Forum. And I'm also a trustee of historic Denver. So I think if I say this earlier, I'm in favor of this.I do think that adding culture allows more communities to have a voice in the process. With historic Denver and with Landmark. We've been working towards a cultural district just in West Denver, in the Lama neighborhood, and we've been able to put forward the idea that it's not always just about one built form, that there are several builtforms that fit into a cultural context and trying to find that. In fact, I had a meeting last week. So as you go down along with me in hopes of gaining our support, which they did, to create a to seek a grant for a cultural context which will help align this all the way around.I will add that, you know, along this process, I was frustrated when the first when I first saw the landmark map, because there were parts of your district and all of West Denver where the key was on top of it.And as you know, in the Chicano movement, if you're not part of the maps, are not part of the conversation. And so we were able to actually work with them and the Justice Department to change that. I think part of the reason you don't hear about a lot of people on the task force who have the skillset is because there aren't any districts in our communities because we've been missing this component. There are very few landmarks in West Denver. It's something that I have put on the strategic plan for historic Denver, and I think things that were working forward.One idea that I've had is I think that during the MPI process we have a great opportunity to educate people about this and other conservation tools. This was in the Blueprint Plan and also to avoid landmarking disputes. We have a really unique opportunity as communities at that time to decide what landmarks are important in their community earlyon in the whole planning process rather than later.Thank you. And quick question for Councilwoman Ortega. I live in Swansea and I know that prior to the I-70 expansion, there were community conversations about making Elyria Historic District. Do you recall what the pushback was on that? Because I know we couldn't meet the criteria, but do you remember what exactly the pushback was about?I believe that was done under Councilwoman Monteiro at the time. It was not something I was directly involved in. And Councilwoman said, what were you working.For at the time of.My that.When that conversation came up? Because I'm not familiar with why that didn't happen. And I do know that in the application of the environmental assessment, it speaks to the neighborhoods, both the Lurie and Swansea, as historic communities because of the longstanding history and specifically the impact the I-70 project has had on those neighborhoods.And I ask this question really to emphasize how difficult it has been for different groups to preserve our communities. I believe that what I recall from that process was that we were told that none of the houses in our district, even though it was a historic neighborhood, were in in good enough condition to consider in a historicdistrict. And I think that this is an excellent move in the right direction to make sure that we have some of those barriers eliminated. Thank you.Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Hines, you back up?Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to have the city come up again for a second. Thank you. So I live in Denver is perfect. Ten and I happen to represent it too. In Denver is perfect ten.I bet you can already anticipate the questions, but for the folks on the outside, there was a conversation around Tom's Diner not too long ago, and I am curious to hear the city's thoughts on how this might the new process might have have affected that that process.Yes. So I know that there were community members who were and still are having conversations with the Thomas of the property owner about is there a way to provide him with the with the appropriate recompense or the money for his property while also being able to preserve the building?And so I know it's a conversation that is still ongoing. I think that had the pause been there, there would have been a little it would have allowed a little more breathing room for the conversation to occur. Instead of feeling like it was being really compressed in to allow that conversation, which is still going on now, tohave been able to do it without the the tight pressure and deadline. And I think it may have helped the process go a little bit smoother.Okay. I mean, I guess so. It's the city's opinion or you're through the stakeholder engagement process is the stakeholder engagement for this. The I'm assuming you guys talked about Tom Steiner or or had you already wrapped up by the time it started.The task force had already completed the work and it was sort of in midsummer. And so it had already gone out to the public for comment. The task force had already completed all of their work on when the Tom Steiner came in for the demo review and then the posting and then the subsequent designation application.Okay. And so the one last thing I would ask about Tom Steiner, I think Councilwoman CdeBaca mentioned in her neighborhood, none of the houses are in good enough quality to be preserved. I, I don't represent beautiful district nine and I'm not as familiar with it.Perhaps the city is more familiar with it. I think that one of the reasons why Tom Steiner was a better opportunity for historic preservation was, frankly, because it wasn't well, it wasn't as well maintained and preserved as as some other locations.So I'm going to guess.Sorry. Yes.So when you're looking to designate something, we look at integrity versus condition. So integrity is does the building convey the reasons for which it would be designated? Would someone who was at that building when it was constructed or when it was historically significant, does it look like that now?But we don't actually look at the condition of the building. Is it a little bit deteriorated? That's not something that comes into the conversation as to whether or not it's eligible to be a landmark. It's the integrity of the building, not the condition of the building.Okay. And so are the buildings in Swansea. Are they is their integrity just degraded or are.There there is integrity in those. I know that the Discover Denver has gone through and has recommended that there are areas or concentrations of buildings in Globeville, Illyria and Swansea that would be eligible to be Denver landmarks. And so we have surveyed all three of the neighborhoods and have found that there are properties that are worthy ofdesignation that retain integrity, and that would be significant. And those were looked at under our previous criteria because we were there a couple of years ago during the survey. If we were looking at it now with the culture it may have, the areas may be slightly expanded.Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilman. All right. See no other questions. The public hearing for comfortable 914 is closed. Comments by members of council. Councilwoman can each.Thank you, Mr. President. I first just wanted to thank all of the members of the task force who participated along the way, as well as those who are here tonight and those who cannot be. Whenever we bring together the community and ask them to spend, you know, a significant amount of time grappling with an issue.It's a service you do to us because you breed debate some of the things that we're going to debate here. And so I. Q is disappointed by our inability to get more representative sampling of folks. We worked hard, we failed, and we are responsible for that and need to continue to reflect on the diversity of the fieldsand the the experience from which we drew. It is my hope, and we did have the most conversation about race and equity with regard to the cultural criteria and how getting beyond just the idea of a famous person where we all remember the name.I mean, history books are written by folks who don't always remember the name of famous people of color. And so the idea that you can know a place is famous to a community without knowing the names of all the participants who might have gone to that home or gone to that business, I think is an equalizer ina way to bring up more opportunities. And so it's my hope that in a generation when we have this conversation, you know, there are a broader array of properties that have come forward. So I think that the culture criteria piece was really important.I want to comment for just a second on the request or the statement that, you know, we came together with the directive from council to, you know, make it harder to designate. That was the directive of several members of council.That was their desire. That was not a vote of the majority of council to see to landmark task force to make it more difficult to designate. There were a diversity of opinions. And Councilman Flynn and I, for example, were appointed with different perspectives on that representative of a council that had a diversity of opinion.So I just want to clarify that while some members wanted that. Others like myself were more concerned about reaching a balance to achieve the goals. One of the debates we had is whether landmark is a neutral process or not, and I think the way to be honest about it is, is not it is about preserving a pieceof the history. It's not neutrally evaluating and then mediating between two parties. It is saying it's important to us as a city that we have pieces of our past that are preserved for future generations. And that future generation piece is an interesting piece of this debate.Right. So are you preserving for the neighbor who lives next door so that nothing ever changes? Are you preserving for, you know, the property owner in terms of their value, which often frankly increases with designation? If you think about LoDo, I don't think anyone would consider that to be an area that has been financially disadvantaged perhaps byby preservation limited in what they can build in how tall. So perhaps on day one there's an economic tradeoff, but the future generation and the long term value. Right, I think in this. So that's what I think this ordinance does.This ordinance says we're in it for the long game and we're protecting some values, not for, you know, me or you, but for those who come way after us. Right. So that they can remember and learn, just as we do when we talk about properties that come through.So. So for me, that's the the vision or the, the values I brought into the process is how to balance that value with these competing interests. But to achieve a vision and a goal, which is what the ordinance preamble really sets out.And in a city that's changing as quickly is done as Denver is, I think that's an important piece. It's not just balancing each property owners interests with each, you know, neighboring interest. It's about balancing the overall rate of change in the city with the overall preservation.So so it's a big task and it's a hard one because then we do come down to individual property decisions. So I really I feel very proud. You know, we we could have chosen to do a majority vote approach, perhaps as a task force.I've certainly been a part of task forces where the goal is to get people's opinions and then the staff goes ahead and makes a recommendation leader. We call it stakeholder input. This process set out for consensus, and I will admit that it disappoints me a little that groups that advocated for tradeoffs during the process and got thosetradeoffs now are asking for additional changes that they were not able to get to consensus at the table. That's hard for me because it feels like a little bit like you got half of what you wanted along the way and then now you're asking for the other half from a different process.But I get that this is democracy and that that's the right of groups to do. I am glad that we're here now with the ordinance we have. I hope folks will consider carefully decisions that try to go to extreme measures.I don't want to see our city mired in retaliatory ballot measure fights like we've seen in our neighboring communities who feel like if we're not able to preserve our history, then we should limit all growth, because that's the kind of conversation this could very quickly spiral into.I don't think that's helpful for us. I think each step forward, we work to get to this place of achieving the goals of the ordinance in a way that is most respectful and most considerate of the owners involved, but can't quite go to the level of saying we'll never do it without permission.Right? We would not have LoDo if we if we needed permission. And so I think that's a decision I can stand by. I can say my predecessors had wisdom and I'm sure my colleague can tell me how many kicks they took about private property rights.But history, I think, will smile on that decision. It's hard to sit in these seats and make the decision at the moment, but I do feel like this ordinance is the right direction, both for meeting the goals of this ordinance as well as for what the city needs today.It was an honor to be a part of it as a total inexperienced individual with no technical knowledge of building types and architecture. But and I appreciate my colleague, Councilman Flynn, who we had we were a microcosm of the debate and yet respectfully worked to find common ground, just like everybody who participated.So I hope this council will find that common ground tonight while we continue to strive for closer to perfection in terms of our inclusiveness of this preservation. Thank you.Thank you. Councilwoman Cameron CdeBaca.Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to thank the task force and Annie and Ms.. Hahn for making sure that even without the representation that was necessary, equity was at the forefront of what you guys were doing here.I speak from personal experience when I say this really opens a door for a lot of opportunities in our community. Having known what happened when our community tried to preserve, to protect against the eminent domain abuse and the highway expansion, and then also watching my brother lose his house, a Victorian house to the national western and protestsall along when the city was trying to take it that it was a historic property, it was a historic property. And to be told no. And then to see a sign posted up the week they were going to demolish it, saying that it was being studied for landmark and historic preservation really shows me how much you allhave been doing to investigate what truly is worth preserving in this city. And so I appreciate it. And I hope to see many more spaces that reflect our contributions to this city preserved and landmarked. So thank you.Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Sandoval.Thank you, Mr. President. I would just like to start by saying thank you to the task force members. Your work on this issue is really important. So over the last four years, we think Council District one, we had three nonlinear historic designations and one historic district.So this update is really important to Northwest Denver and important to the district that I represent. I'm excited about the addition of culture. A couple of years ago, we wanted to look at preserving Navajo Street as an Italian district and Italian area as the Italians had moved out.And there was no way to do that and there is no tool in the toolbox. And so now that is gone. And that said and done, and unfortunately it's a little bit too late for that. So thank you for adding the cultural piece.And I just want to talk about the pause. Currently right now in Council District one on 46th and Tennyson. There is a non owner historic designation application in the Q and what we did was we looked at this ordinance and I took advantage of this pause and I asked both parties to come together and have a thirdparty facilitator. And a pause was agreed to. So we are taking a 60 day pause on that application right now. Last week was the hearing, and it's postponed to November 12th to try to find different different outcomes for that property.So I really do think that this pause can work. And then another issue has come up is last month I attended a city led community presentation about a possible historic district in northwest Denver. And it was the first time in all the years.Of working in city council since 2012, where the city led the process and the city sent out the invitation. And it was very informative. It was very neutral. Both everyone was able to come out. It wasn't the applicants, it was the city.So I want and then they're going to also take advantage of this survey without this ordinance being implemented. So Council District One is already taking advantage of many of these ideas that have come forward through this task force and these recommendations.And I'm excited for them because I remember sitting over the past four years, sitting in the council office, hearing hours of testimony and knowing the houses intimately that were up and watching, feeling very conflicted about what type of preservation was needed, and the fact that 13 council members get to decide the future of neighborhood character in northwestDenver. And it just did not seem fair. So I just have to say thank you all for working on this, because this is, as you all can see, northwest Denver has been the battleground because the one historic property that they mentioned in their presentation, Beth Eaton Church, that's once again in Council District one on law.So Northwest Denver really has been the battleground for the past five years with historic designation, the certificate of non historic status. And I've sat at the table during that 21 day time clock where a certificate of non historic status came in.As a council aide, I had to reach out. I had to get there are no I had to get everyone at the table. I had to negotiate some of them and some of the applications got pulled. And with the help of historic Denver, the applicant was actually refunded the $200 when they had when they pulled their certificateof non historic status. And I will tell you it is stressful, it is not proactive work and so thank you for being proactive and just I really cannot thank you enough for working on this and I hope that the pause works regardless.It's a form of communication and sometimes on the other side of conflict and uneasy conversations, good things can come out. So thank you for your work. Thank you, President.Thank you, Councilwoman Kelton Gilmore.Thank you, President Clark. You know, I want to thank Kara and Annie and the task force and of course, the important work and time of my colleagues, Councilwoman each and Councilman Flynn. And I am pleased with a majority of the additions and changes, including adding culture.That being said, I am always troubled when there might be a process, especially through the owner opposed landmark designation that private property rights would be violated or affected. And it's disappointing that the task force didn't look at at least raising the bar by either a vote of nine or ten members of city council to really encourage folksto come to the table and get to what was said here tonight, a win win outcome. And when Councilwoman Black and I had both proposed in committee to require only on the honor imposed designations a supermajority, we were unsuccessful in getting that support.And I honor the opinions and background of my colleagues. But I also want us to be looking closely at how this unrolls, how it plays out. I agree with Ian's comment about, you know, when we don't get to participate in this process in our neighborhoods, it makes it very hard.Were put at a disadvantage to be part of the process to understand items that are very technical that you said here tonight. If we don't get the opportunity to play in that arena, then we are at a disadvantage.And so I appreciate, you know, Kara reaching out, us having a good conversation and I will be supportive of this tonight. Thank you, President Clark.Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Cashman.Thank you, Mr. President. I had my thanks to the staff and to the task force for the good work that they did. And I want to thank.My colleagues for.Continuing.To bring.Up the importance of equity.In everything that we're doing in the city.Just finished our budget.Presentations and for the first time, I think in the city's history, equity is.Is held up as a top.Value. We have an enormous.Amount of work to do to figure out how to actually address that. But but it's on the.Table and as it should have been for a long time. I appreciated what Councilman Kennedy said. As far as what we're doing here is an acknowledgment.That.Preservation of the.Important parts of our past is a community that, as well as equity preservation, have important elements of our past is an important value.I also very much appreciated Councilwoman Gilmore and Councilwoman Black's putting forth a couple of amendments. I have struggled over the issue of should there be a higher bar on owner opposed.And I was.Very convinced that there should be looking at the reality of how things have played out that we've had one owner opposed pass in six years. I'm wondering if, along with the pause that this new package brings forward, if we might have hit on what we need as far as that tool to.To better solve those contentious.Situations.There are enormously.Painful district one had a couple when when I first came on council and they are enormously painful trying to weigh the community's well-being with.Private property owners.Well-Being. I will be anxious to see how this latest tool.Helps resolve those.Tensions. I have a hunch that that it will do a great deal in that regard. The last thing I wanted to mention is, is the need, as it was talked about, for increased funding for Discovery Denver. You know, we have what was it, 18% of the city is covered and that's wonderful.But that even I can.Do that math. Councilman Hines, that's.82% of the city that's that's not covered. And that's a potential tragedy.And we those of us who have been around Denver a long time, have seen a whole lot of important structures go away that I.Think would have made a wonderful education of of where.Denver has been and how we got to where we are today. So I would hope that as we go through the budget process, we can find some money to accelerate that the Discover Denver effort.So with that, again.Congratulations on.A lot of good hard.Work and I look forward to supporting this this evening.Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Ortega.Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to share my appreciation to all of you who were involved in this process, in bringing to us what is very clear was a compromise document with lots of give and take on both sides.And so to Kara and Annie, appreciate your your help along with my colleagues as well for your input in bringing something forward. When we did the lower downtown historic district, not everybody was happy with that either. But time showed that after the second two year review, everybody came forward and said, Just get rid of it.Just get rid of it, because we're happy with the way it's working. And so I think and if it's not, guess what? We can bring it back. It doesn't mean we're locked in stone if it's not working. But I think we've got to give it a try.And I just have to say, I live in one of these old houses and they're not cheap to maintain, right, if you want to maintain the character of it. So being able to have access to the various incentives becomes really important, whether it's being able to add on a unit, if you've got a lot size big enoughto do that or you know, if it's just accessing some of the historic funds from the state or the National Trust for Historic Preservation, that also makes resources available. So for people in our community who are wanting to do the right thing, I think it is important that we have those tools readily available to them where theydon't have to like hunt all over town to find them, but to be able to go to one place where it's easy to access the information and then know what's available to them. To be successful in trying to preserve their property.The data alone shows that with all the applications that have been brought forward, they don't all make it to the floor of council. So the the work that is done by our city staff in historic Denver and in trying to lay out the information because oftentimes you guys are the go to place for for people to tryto, you know, pull the information. Our library is great, but oftentimes you already have much of that history on Denver neighborhoods and properties. And so that that makes it a little bit, you know, easier for people to just pull their their applications together.So so I think the the process has worked. And again, you know, some of those that have come before this body, they have an all they haven't all been approved either. Some of them have. Some of them have not.But I wanted to speak very briefly to the Swans here neighborhood and the fact that during the time that the environmental assessment was was being put together, the state, when they looked at the mitigation issues, they did not want to tinker with the exterior windows because of the historic character of the neighborhood.And it's probably a lot to do with cost as well, but that's why they ended up only doing interior windows for the residents that were within 500 feet of each side of the highway. I appreciate the fact that culture is being added because I think that there are lots of things like if you look at Santa Feand some of the buildings along Santa Fe, that played a big role, the Walton Street corridor that was spoken to earlier. You know, across our city, we have some areas of town that played a major role in the history of our city that oftentimes are never included in the history books that our kids learn about our city. Right. Or their community. They're getting Western history information and European history, but not typically their own local history. And the contributions that, you know, people from their own community made in in shaping the city of what it is today.So I think we've got a great roadmap in front of us and a tremendous opportunity to utilize the criteria in a in a different way that I think will create more flexibility for the applicants. And at the same time, I think having those incentives will encourage more people to look at trying to take advantage of saving.Part of the history of our city, because I live in a neighborhood that doesn't look anything like what it used to. And every day very nice brick structures are being just torn down. And if you live on one side, a zoo, nice street, you're in a protected part.If you're on the other side, you're in the neighborhood where it's drastically changing. So this is a good thing. Thank you. I'll be voting for it.Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Hines.Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank the committee for all the hard work that you've done. You know, I'm new on council, not as new as I was a couple of months ago, but still new. And as I sit here on Monday nights and in committee, you get to learn a little bit more about my values. I also get to learn a bit more about my own values. I get a little bit of self reflection as well, and I think that's healthy for all of us to have this growing process together. But speaking of values, I talked earlier about stakeholder process and transparency, and I.I learned briefly, or rather I learned quickly about the importance of the stakeholder process. A lot of people talked about the climate change bill and how they were frustrated, frustrated with the lack of stakeholder process. Frankly, from my perspective, President Clark reached out to me the day after I won the runoff election.So he was all over it. As far as you know, as far as I knew that his stakeholder process was robust. But anyway, I really enjoy that this process had a robust stakeholder process and that it considered, you know, private property rights, it considered a supermajority.It decided to go with the the compromise that we see in front of us. You know, I, too, am interested in private property rights. When I heard about Tom Steiner, or rather when Tom Steiner came before us, you know, it also was in divorce.Perfect ten. We heard a lot about private property rights from people all over the U.S. and maybe some beyond. But certainly we had people from all over the United States writing in to the District ten office and and talking about private property rights.So I recognize that that's an important consideration for a lot of people all over America and including people in District ten. I also think that it is important for us to not. To be very measured when we arbitrarily limit City Council's power and a supermajority of nine or ten votes makes it more difficult for us to effectivelyrepresent the city because we are representing our districts. And. And if we go from a majority to a supermajority, I think that that makes it more difficult for for me to represent my district, even if the particular vote is in a different district.So I'm glad that we are at least taking this incremental approach and we're considering a straight majority. And the funky math is we are going from two thirds threshold to 30% or from 20% to 30%. And apparently both of those calculations work.But either way, I think it's great that we've had a stakeholder process that has come up with what we what we have in front of us today. So I will be supporting it. Thank you.Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Sawyer.Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to point out that I reached out to my constituents when I was asked to consider the idea of a supermajority and with just a very nonscientific survey among people.And 57% of them came back and said that they supported a nine vote supermajority. So I think, you know, I think that I'm very supportive of the the ordinance as it's coming through tonight. I think it's a great ordinance.I'm really you know, I really congratulate all of you guys who worked so hard on this. But I do think that there is an element of awareness in our community that did not exist before this summer, when Tom's Diner happened, when when that situation came through, that has sort of woke in the community up to the issueof personal property rights in a way that maybe didn't exist before. And so maybe next time around, it's something that should come back up and be considered again. I definitely am supportive of tonight, but I just wanted to put it out there that when I asked and reached out to my constituents, 57% did support a nine personsupermajority. So thank you, Mr. President.Thank you, Councilwoman. So, Councilman Flynn.Thank you, Mr. President. I, I, too, want to thank the staff and the members of the task force with whom I served and Councilwoman Keech for a very robust discussion and process that truly did land in the center where people on one side or another are always giving up something and never getting everything they want.I really do want to thank them for that. I did learn one thing in this process on the task force that surprised me, and that is that when we had those contentious, excuse me, landmark things up in District one, that all three of which were defeated.I realized through this task force process that it wasn't that necessarily that we were being harder and more strict on owner opposed applications. I realized that we were being much less strict, much more lenient, if you will, on owner supported.And one that came to mind in particular was in Councilman Cashman's district on South Adam Street. I think it was the I Love House or what was it, their very large property on South Adams Street where the owner came in and sought designation.And I, I realized that far from being harder on the ones that were owner opposed, we were sort of just being of the owner wants it. Sure, I can see how it fits all the criteria. And that was a real eye opener for me.The other thing that I really like about this version is the addition of the cultural criteria, because I believe, as I believe, Councilwoman Torres, I was the one who mentioned the lack of designations on the West Sides, particularly Southwest side.There's only one designated landmark in Denver, south of Sixth Avenue and west of the Platte River, and that's the field officers quarters in on Fort Logan on the parade ground. Well, thanks to the Loreto Heights plan that we adopted a couple of weeks ago, there will soon be more.The Loreto Heights Academy in the chapel, possibly Pancreases Hall and looking down the road to a district designation on the campus as well. But with the cultural criteria being added, I think we can look beyond these large, obvious landmarking options that we have and look to more that more designations that speak to the to the people whobuilt this city and the people who made this city. And I'm looking forward to scouring perhaps with Councilwoman Torres scouring the West Side and looking for opportunities and to solicit more more applications from owners who are willing to do this.So I will be supporting this. Mr. President, thank you.Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Ortega, did you have some quick things?I don't know why they're still up there. All right.All right. Well, I will just close this before we vote by saying one more time thank you to all the task force members for all the time they put in. Thank you to Councilman Flynn and Councilman Ken each for representing some different sides of the coin for us in this process and all the extra hours that tookinto our staff for going through all of this. I will be supporting this tonight. Madam Secretary, roll call.See the burqa. I flip.All right.Gilmore, I. Hi.Yes.Cashman. Can I? Ortega. Sandoval. Sawyer.I.Torres. I heard they.Argument.Mr. President.All right. I'm secretary. Please. Cause voting in those results.12 hours.12 hours. Council Bill 914 has passed.

Steve Scott, take it away.Good evening. Council members, just real quickly, this is part of a project that we have targeted for Harwell for some time. We've enhanced project with some measuring dollars, and it goes along with our efforts to modernize our our irrigation system citywide and all of our parks and medians.This is an important project as far as how we operate in in Hartwell. Currently, it's a manual system and it's one of our older systems that one of the reasons we prioritized it for replacement. That concludes our report and are available for questions.Thank you, Councilmember Mongo.We've had significant community outreach. It's been a project that's been going back and forth for about four years. We're glad to finally move forward and update the irrigation system. So I hope that my colleagues will support.Kay Price.I support this. Awesome. I hope we have something like this at all the parks in time. I know it's very expensive, but I'm glad we're doing it with Hartwell because it's a third of Hartwell because it's a it's a really well used park.So thank you.It's great public comment. See non.

The committee recommends that the petition be granted as conditioned.Castro O'Brien.Thanks. We're back to street vacations. This one is the conceptual approval. So we heard from the project, which is just to the let's see, just to the east of the Berkman Trail, just east of University of Washington campus, and to the west of University Village.The there is a street there, 24th Avenue Northeast. That is a dead end at that ends at the trail. And it previously accessed apartment buildings that are being cleared for this new project, which is a few hundred units of private student housing to go in there.The street was is no longer necessary. It would only access this project. And so they are asking to vacate that and paying the fee for that. And as part of the public benefit there, we're going to produce a new connection between the Berkman Trail and and the University Village.I'm sorry, I mentioned 24th Avenue Northeast. The streamer vacating is for Northeast 48th Street. This would access 24th Avenue Northeast for folks that are familiar with the Berkman Trail up there, the trails heading north. This is where there's a number of overpasses that cross over to to check out pavilion signs that Alaska Council president of Alaska Airlinescartoon court.Known as the Heck Edmonds Pavilion.And then to the parking lots to the further north of that. As you get further north on the Berkman Trail, if you're if you're running her by calling or whatever, you can kind of sense that the university village is off to your right there.But there's really no good way to get there. There's a little footpath that winds down through the dirt there and then you wait around to the north. What this would do is we create a very visible and open graded trail.It would be ADA accessible that has all the way down to 24th Avenue Northeast. There's another project that will be making improvements in 24th Avenue Northeast to make a much safer pedestrian crossing over to University Village. In addition to providing that new public trail access, they'll be providing a bicycle repair station like we see.It's a number of places and also a water bottle refilling station there. In addition to some seating. Actually, it seems like a really great public benefit for this location. I really appreciate the proponents coming up with some creative ideas.And of course, thanks to the folks at our start, in particular Beverly Barnette, for her work on helping them guide them through the process and making sure that the project came up with public benefits that are in the interest of the whole city.This is the conceptual approval. So this is where we essentially give our thumbs up. It's just a clerk file. But we will be committing to grant the ultimate vacation likely in a couple of years when the project is complete.And they've built this according to these plans.Very good. Any questions or comments on this Clark file? Those in favor of granting the petition as conditions. Please vote I. I would oppose vote no. The motion carries the petition is granted as condition chair was signed the conditions of the City Council approved.Please read the next gen item.Agenda item 13 Appointment 1353 Appointment of Brice Colton as Members Cell Transit Advisory Board for Term two August 2nd, 2020.
