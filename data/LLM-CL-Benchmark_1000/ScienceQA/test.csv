Question:
What information supports the conclusion that Trudy inherited this trait?

Hint:
Read the description of a trait.
Trudy has brown eyes.

Choices:
A. Trudy's father has brown eyes. He passed this trait down to Trudy.
B. Trudy's hair is the same color as her brown eyes.

Answer:","A
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

The metaphor the only light in the sea of darkness was the prospect of pursuing a new career suggests that there was a benefit to Zeke's job loss. A light would be beneficial in helping someone escape a dark, difficult-to-navigate situation. Similarly, Zeke's new career was beneficial in helping him escape the emotionally difficult experience of losing his job."
"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Does the sentence use a simile or a metaphor?
Marie went down the slide face-first, like a penguin.

Choices:
A. simile
B. metaphor

Answer:","A
Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader.Marie went down the slide face-first, like a penguin.
The words Marie and penguin are compared using the word like. So, the sentence uses a simile."

Question:
What is the volume of a test tube?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 13 liters
B. 13 milliliters

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters.The better estimate for the volume of a test tube is 13 milliliters.
13 liters is too much."

Question:
Compare the motion of two mountain bikers. Which mountain biker was moving at a lower speed?

Choices:
A. a mountain biker who moved 190miles in 10hours
B. a mountain biker who moved 100miles in 10hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.Look at the distance each mountain biker moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One mountain biker moved 100 miles in 10 hours.
The other mountain biker moved 190 miles in 10 hours.
Notice that each mountain biker spent the same amount of time moving. The mountain biker who moved 100 miles moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that mountain biker must have moved at a lower speed."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Sage's phenotype for the coat color trait?

Hint:
In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Sage is a horse from this group. Sage has the homozygous genotype ll for the coat color gene.

Choices:
A. a black coat
B. a reddish-brown coat

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Sage's genotype for the coat color gene is ll. Sage's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for a reddish-brown coat. So, Sage's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Sage's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Sage's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Sage's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
sawing a log in half
stretching a rubber band

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","B
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Sawing a log in half is a physical change. The log splits into two pieces. But the pieces are still made of the same type of matter.
Stretching a rubber band is a physical change. The rubber band gets longer. But it is still made of the same type of matter as before.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Snowflakes forming in a cloud is a ().

Choices:
A. physical change
B. chemical change

Answer:","A
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.Snowflakes forming in a cloud is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed."

When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.
A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length.The best estimate for the length of an ice skate is 34 centimeters.
34 meters and 34 kilometers are both too long."

Which figure of speech is used in this text?
Deb insisted that her dog wasn't fat; she said that he was merely well-fed.

Choices:
A. paradox

Which text uses the word ironic in its traditional sense?

Choices:
A. Last winter, Clarence took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week.
B. Last winter, Clarence took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, he just missed a few of his college friends, who had been in Florida the previous week.

Answer:","A
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The second text uses ironic in its traditional sense: contrary to what was intended, often in an amusing way. It's ironic because Clarence tried to get away from the snow but found himself in a snowstorm regardless.
Last winter, Clarence took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week.
The first text uses ironic in its nontraditional sense: marked by coincidence. It was a coincidence that Clarence's friends were in Florida the week before.
Last winter, Clarence took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, he just missed a few of his college friends, who had been in Florida the previous week.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word ironic because it is generally considered incorrect."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Digby's genotype for the fur length gene?

Hint:
In a group of dogs, some individuals have short fur and others have long fur. In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele F is for short fur, and the allele f is for long fur.
Digby, a dog from this group, has short fur. Digby has two alleles for short fur.

Choices:
A. short fur
B. FF

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Digby has two alleles for short fur (F). So, Digby's genotype for the fur length gene is FF."

Question:
Which sentence uses a metaphor?

Choices:
A. The tired boy was a slow turtle.
B. The tired boy was as slow as a turtle.

Answer:","A
Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader.This sentence uses a metaphor:

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
The thing that makes Santiago stand out as a remarkable cellist is that he's a marvelous musician who plays the cello splendidly.

Choices:
A. slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences
B. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
C. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Santiago is a remarkable cellist because he plays the cello well. However, the ""evidence"" is just a restatement of the claim itself. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as circular reasoning."

Assume all other forces on the ice cube are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on the ice cube?

Hint:
An ice cube is floating in a glass of water. Earth's gravity is pulling down on the ice cube with a force of 0.1N. The water is pushing up on the ice cube with a force of 0.1N.

Choices:
A. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the ice cube.
B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the ice cube.

Answer:","B
A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.To determine if there is a net force on the ice cube, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling the ice cube down with a force of 0.1 N.
The water is pushing the ice cube up with a force of 0.1 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 0.1 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the ice cube."

cold water
a pile of dirty dishes

Choices:
A. Are dishes washed in a dishwasher cleaner than dishes washed by hand?
B. Are dishes cleaner when washed with a soapy sponge or with a soapy rag?
C. Are dishes cleaner when washed with liquid dish detergent or with bar soap?

Answer:","C
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

B. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the slice of pizza.

Answer:","B
A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.To determine if there is a net force on the slice of pizza, look at the forces:
Quinn is pulling the slice of pizza left with a force of 50 N.
Brad is pulling the slice of pizza right with a force of 45 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 50 N and 45 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the slice of pizza."

B. Dr. Larson and her team took horses and went to a place that had no modern medical services.

Answer:","A
Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples

idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store

Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses overly simple or imprecise language (took, went).

Question:
Based on this information, what is this pea plant's genotype for the stem height gene?

Hint:
In a group of pea plants, some individuals have a tall stem and others have a short stem. In this group, the gene for the stem height trait has two alleles. The allele H is for a tall stem, and the allele h is for a short stem.
A certain pea plant from this group has a tall stem. This plant has two alleles for a tall stem.

Choices:
A. HH
B. a tall stem

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The pea plant has two alleles for a tall stem (H). So, the plant's genotype for the stem height gene is HH."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
making paper from wood
roasting a marshmallow over a campfire

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","B
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Making paper from wood is a chemical change. Paper is made by mixing tiny pieces of wood with special chemicals. The wood reacts with the chemicals to form pulp. Wood and pulp are different types of matter.
Roasting a marshmallow is a chemical change. The type of matter on the outside of the marshmallow changes. As a marshmallow is roasted, it turns brown and crispy.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Roasting is caused by heating. But making paper from wood is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Is this a run-on sentence?
Right-handedness is controlled by genetics, interestingly enough, the same genes are also responsible for the brain becoming more specialized at certain tasks.

Choices:
A. yes
B. no

Answer:","A
A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.
There are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:
Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.

Question:
Which object has more thermal energy?

Hint:
The objects are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. a 240-gram bottle of water at a temperature of 25°C
B. a 240-gram bottle of water at a temperature of 10°C

Answer:","A
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.The two bottles of water have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 25°C bottle of water is hotter than the 10°C bottle of water, it has more thermal energy."

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that the skydiver's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the skydiver and Earth () as she drifted toward the flat ground.

Hint:
Read the text about a person in motion.
A skydiver jumped out of a plane. After thirty seconds, she opened up her parachute and drifted toward the flat ground.

Choices:
A. increased
B. decreased
C. stayed the same

Answer:","B
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the skydiver and the center of Earth changed.
The ground was lower than the point where the skydiver opened up her parachute. As she drifted toward the ground, the distance between the skydiver and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the skydiver and Earth decreased as she drifted toward the flat ground."

How long is a human front tooth?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:

Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. Eva smiled and said hello when she ran into Anna at the post office.
B. When Eva ran into Anna at the post office, she smiled and said hello.

Answer:","B
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:

Last year, 50,000 people lived in the city of Richmond. But since then, 8,000 people have moved away. What probably happened to the overall supply of houses for sale in Richmond?

Choices:
A. The supply probably went down.
B. The supply probably went up.

Answer:","B
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.The population of Richmond fell by 8,000 people. Many of the people who have left are probably trying to sell their houses. Since more people are trying to sell their houses, the number of suppliers of houses for sale in Richmond has gone up.

Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.
Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.
Water freezing into ice is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The water changes from solid to liquid. But the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Dry ice sublimating is caused by heating. But water freezing into ice is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Water freezing is caused by cooling. But dry ice sublimating is not."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
I'm never setting foot in any seafood restaurant again. We just had a ridiculously overpriced dinner at Mateo's Seafood Hut, and I have no interest in repeating that experience.

Choices:
A. hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence
B. red herring: the use of a completely unrelated topic or idea

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that all seafood restaurants are overpriced. However, even though one seafood restaurant was overpriced, that doesn't necessarily mean that all seafood restaurants are overpriced. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a hasty generalization."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
a puddle freezing into ice on a cold night
mixing sand and water

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","C
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.
Mixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.

Question:
Based on this information, what is Boxer's genotype for the coat color gene?

Hint:
In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele L is for a black coat, and the allele l is for a reddish-brown coat.
Boxer, a horse from this group, has a black coat. Boxer has one allele for a black coat and one allele for a reddish-brown coat.

Choices:
A. Ll
B. a black coat

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Boxer has one allele for a black coat (L) and one allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). So, Boxer's genotype for the coat color gene is Ll."

Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.

Question:
Based on this information, what is Cleo's phenotype for the fur color trait?

Hint:
In a group of rock pocket mice, some individuals have dark fur and others have light fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for light fur (f) is recessive to the allele for dark fur (F).
Cleo is a rock pocket mouse from this group. Cleo has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur color gene.

Choices:
A. light fur
B. dark fur

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Cleo's genotype for the fur color gene is ff. Cleo's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for light fur. So, Cleo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be light fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Cleo's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for light fur (f) is recessive to the allele for dark fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Cleo's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Cleo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be light fur."

A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.
There are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:
Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.

access to a grassy lawn
access to a gravel driveway
a meterstick

Choices:
A. Do larger basketballs bounce higher than smaller basketballs on a brick patio?
B. Does the basketball bounce higher on a lawn or on a dirt path?
C. Does the basketball bounce higher on gravel or on grass?

Answer:","C
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma.
I knocked on the door it opened.
It started raining, we ran inside.
To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.

Question:
Select the solid.

Choices:
A. piece of paper
B. rain
C. air inside a bubble

Answer:","A
Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a shape of its own.
Some solids can be bent or broken easily. Others are hard to bend or break.
A glass cup is a solid. A sock is also a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it takes the shape of its container.
Think about pouring a liquid from a cup into a bottle. The shape of the liquid is different in the cup than in the bottle. But the liquid still takes up the same amount of space.
Juice is a liquid. Honey is also a liquid.
When matter is a gas, it spreads out to fill a space.
Many gases are invisible. So, you can’t see them. Air is a gas.Rain is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you put rainwater into a bucket, the rainwater will take the shape of the bucket. But the rainwater will still take up the same amount of space.
The air inside a bubble is a gas. A gas spreads out to fill a space. The air inside a bubble fills all the space in the bubble. If the bubble pops, the air will spread out to fill a much larger space.

Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear main idea and develop it with evidence, examples, and analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that the ideas build on one another and are easy to follow?
Sentence fluency: Do the writer's sentences vary in structure and length, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely, avoiding excessive repetition or inappropriate language to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer use accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?The writer could best improve his or her word choice by using more specific language.

Based on this information, what is Algernon's genotype for the fur color gene?

Hint:
In a group of rabbits, some individuals have black fur and others have brown fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele F is for black fur, and the allele f is for brown fur.
Algernon, a rabbit from this group, has brown fur. Algernon has two alleles for brown fur.

Choices:
A. brown fur
B. ff

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Algernon has two alleles for brown fur (f). So, Algernon's genotype for the fur color gene is ff."

B. The odor emanating from the landfill made Danielle so nauseous that she had to roll up the car windows as she drove past.

Answer:","A
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The second text uses nauseous in its traditional sense: causing disgust or nausea.

To help relieve pain during a dental visit, a dentist may give a patient nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is made in factories by carefully heating ammonium nitrate. At 170°C, ammonium nitrate breaks down and forms a mixture of nitrous oxide gas and water vapor. After the mixture is collected, the water vapor is separated from the nitrous oxide gas.

Choices:
A. reactant
B. product

Answer:","A
A chemical change occurs when new substances are formed from existing substances. This process is called a chemical reaction.
In a chemical reaction, one or more substances change into one or more different substances. During the reaction, the atoms of the original substances are rearranged to form other substances.
The original substances in a chemical reaction are called reactants. These substances react, or go through a chemical change.
The substances that are formed in a chemical reaction are called products. These substances are produced by the chemical reaction.
So, in a chemical reaction, reactants go through a chemical change to form products.Read the underlined text carefully. Look for information about what happens to ammonium nitrate in this chemical reaction.
To help relieve pain during a dental visit, a dentist may give a patient nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is made in factories by carefully heating ammonium nitrate. At 170°C, ammonium nitrate breaks down and forms a mixture of nitrous oxide gas and water vapor. After the mixture is collected, the water vapor is separated from the nitrous oxide gas.
The underlined text tells you that when ammonium nitrate breaks down, nitrous oxide and water are formed.

Select the one substance that is not a mineral.

Choices:
A. Native gold is not made by living things. It is a pure substance.
B. Galena is not made by living things. It is formed in nature.
C. Soap is made in a factory. It is a solid.

Answer:","C
Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Soap is made in a factory. But all minerals are formed in nature.
So, soap is not a mineral.
Galena is a mineral.

C. a meatball at a temperature of 20°C

Answer:","C
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.All three meatballs have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 20°C meatball is the coldest, it has the least thermal energy."
"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Select the liquid.

Choices:
A. chair
B. baseball
C. water in a waterfall
D. air from a hair dryer

Answer:","C
Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.A baseball is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. If you hit a baseball with a bat, the baseball will still have a size and shape of its own.
The air from a hair dryer is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. A hair dryer uses a fan to blow warm air out. When the air leaves the hair dryer, the air expands to fill a much large space.
The water in a waterfall is a liquid. A liquid can change shape. But it still takes up the same amount of space. As water flows down a waterfall, the water changes shape.
A chair is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When you sit on a chair, it keeps its shape."

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that the sled's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth () as Rita rode down the hill.

Hint:
Read the text about an object in motion.
On a snowy day, Rita rode her sled down a big hill.

Choices:
A. decreased
B. increased
C. stayed the same

Answer:","A
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the sled and the center of Earth changed.
The bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Rita started sledding. As Rita rode toward the bottom of the hill, the distance between the sled and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased as Rita rode down the hill."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Nibbles's phenotype for the body size trait?

Hint:
In a group of rats, some individuals have a normal-sized body and others have a dwarf body. In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b).
Nibbles is a rat from this group. Nibbles has the homozygous genotype BB for the body size gene.

Choices:
A. a normal-sized body
B. a dwarf body

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Nibbles's genotype for the body size gene is BB. Nibbles's genotype of BB has only B allelles. The B allele is for a normal-sized body. So, Nibbles's phenotype for the body size trait must be a normal-sized body.
To check this answer, consider whether Nibbles's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Nibbles's genotype of BB has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Nibbles's phenotype for the body size trait must be a normal-sized body."

Question:
Compare the motion of three bicycles. Which bicycle was moving at the highest speed?

Choices:
A. a bicycle that moved 30miles east in 5hours
B. a bicycle that moved 70miles west in 5hours
C. a bicycle that moved 35miles east in 5hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed.Look at the distance each bicycle moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each bicycle moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each bicycle moved for 5 hours. The bicycle that moved 70 miles moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that bicycle must have moved at the highest speed."

Answer:","A
An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately.The source of the allusion an albatross around her neck is a poem.
In Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"" a sailor shoots and kills an albatross, an action that curses the ship and crew. As his crew members die, the Ancient Mariner feels his guilt hanging like the albatross around his neck.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
a penny tarnishing
an old sandwich rotting in a trashcan

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","A
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
A sandwich rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the sandwich breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.

How long is a school bus?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 14 meters
B. 14 kilometers

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.

C. a sailboat that moved 65kilometers east in 5hours

Answer:","A
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed.Look at the distance each sailboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each sailboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each sailboat moved for 5 hours. The sailboat that moved 70 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that sailboat must have moved at the highest speed."

Question:
Based on this information, what is this scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait?

Hint:
In a group of scarlet rosemallow plants, some individuals have red flowers and others have white flowers. In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele F is for red flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers.
A certain scarlet rosemallow plant from this group has white flowers. This plant has two alleles for white flowers.

Choices:
A. white flowers
B. ff

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The scarlet rosemallow plant's observable version of the flower color trait is white flowers. So, the plant's phenotype for the flower color trait is white flowers."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
a puddle freezing into ice on a cold night
beating an egg

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","C
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.
Beating an egg is a physical change. Beating an egg mixes together the egg white, egg yolk, and some air. But mixing them together does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
A puddle freezing is caused by cooling. But beating an egg is not."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Mr. Goodman argues that we need to do more to prevent workplace injuries and fatalities. I doubt that someone so socially awkward would know a thing about office safety.

Choices:
A. ad hominem: a personal attack against one's opponent
B. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that being socially awkward determines knowledge of workplace safety. This is a personal attack that isn't relevant to Mr. Goodman's desire to prevent workplace injuries. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as ad hominem."

Question:
Select the part that contains the information that a plant cell uses for growth and activities.

Choices:
A. chloroplasts
B. chromosomes
C. mitochondria
D. Golgi

Answer:","B
Plant cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.
Some cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:
Chloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.
The nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.
After proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.
In plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.
Other cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.
The cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.
On the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.
The cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts.Chromosomes contain the information that the cell uses for growth and activities. This information helps control what the cell does and how it grows and develops.
In plant and animal cells, the chromosomes are inside the nucleus."

Question:
Which block of concrete has less thermal energy?

Hint:
Two 5-kilogram blocks of concrete are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. the colder block of concrete
B. the hotter block of concrete

Answer:","A
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 1-kilogram brick at 70°F has half as much thermal energy as a 2-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the smaller brick has half as many atoms. So, it has half as much thermal energy.The two blocks of concrete are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder block of concrete has less thermal energy."

What information supports the conclusion that Maureen inherited this trait?

Hint:
Read the description of a trait.
Maureen has wavy hair.

Choices:
A. Maureen's parents were born with wavy hair. They passed down this trait to Maureen.
B. Maureen and her mother both have short hair.

Answer:","A
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
I pulled Billy off the project because his work was sloppy. While we're at it, let's pull Maggie off the project, too. I haven't reviewed her work, but she's friends with Billy, so we cannot rely on the quality of her work either.

Choices:
A. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
B. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
C. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something

Answer:","C
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Maggie's work is low quality because her friend's work is low quality. However, the work of Maggie's friend does not necessarily reflect the quality of Maggie's work. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
snails growing shells
photosynthesis

Choices:
A. Both are caused by heating.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","B
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Snails growing shells is a chemical change. A snail's body uses calcium from its food to make a new molecule called calcium carbonate. This calcium carbonate is used to grow the shell.
Photosynthesis is a chemical change. Plants make sugar using carbon dioxide, water, and energy from sunlight.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.

B. Mr. Russo wanted the new employees to fill out their intake forms, but he couldn't find them.

Answer:","B
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:

2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses a contraction (can't).

What do these two changes have in common?
butter melting on a hot day
cooking an egg

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","B
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked egg and raw egg are different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Butter melting on a hot day is a physical change. But cooking an egg is not.
Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","D
Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.An arrowhead is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. An arrowhead is made of rock.
An eraser is a solid. You can bend an eraser. But it will still have a size and shape of its own.
Vinegar is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour vinegar into a different container, the vinegar will take the shape of that container. But the vinegar will still take up the same amount of space.

Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The second text uses factoid in its traditional sense: something made up presented as a true fact.
As a geneticist, Suzie dislikes many popular sci-fi movies because they often present audiences with factoids that misrepresent her field.
The first text uses factoid in its nontraditional sense: a trivial but true fact.
As a geneticist, Suzie enjoys watching science documentaries and sharing various factoids she's learned with her colleagues.

Question:
Select the vertebrate.

Hint:
Hint: Mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians are vertebrates.

Choices:
A. ladybug
B. peacock mantis shrimp
C. fire salamander
D. metallic tarantula

Answer:","C
Vertebrates and invertebrates are both groups of animals.
A vertebrate has a backbone. The backbone is made of many bones in an animal's back. A vertebrate's backbone helps connect the different parts of its body. In the drawings below, each vertebrate's backbone is colored orange.
An invertebrate does not have a backbone. In fact, invertebrates do not have any bones! Some invertebrates have an outer cover on their body called an exoskeleton. Other invertebrates have a soft body.A ladybug is an insect. Like other insects, a ladybug is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton.
A fire salamander is an amphibian. Like other amphibians, a fire salamander is a vertebrate. It has a backbone.
Like other tarantulas, a metallic tarantula is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton.
A peacock mantis shrimp is a crustacean. Like other crustaceans, a peacock mantis shrimp is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton."

Question:
Compare the motion of two mountain bikers. Which mountain biker was moving at a lower speed?

Choices:
A. a mountain biker who moved 95miles in 5hours
B. a mountain biker who moved 65miles in 5hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.Look at the distance each mountain biker moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One mountain biker moved 65 miles in 5 hours.
The other mountain biker moved 95 miles in 5 hours.
Notice that each mountain biker spent the same amount of time moving. The mountain biker who moved 65 miles moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that mountain biker must have moved at a lower speed."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Mr. Kemp argues that we need to do more to prevent workplace injuries and fatalities. I doubt that someone so socially awkward would know a thing about office safety.

Choices:
A. ad hominem: a personal attack against one's opponent
B. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that being socially awkward determines knowledge of workplace safety. This is a personal attack that isn't relevant to Mr. Kemp's desire to prevent workplace injuries. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as ad hominem."

Which object has less thermal energy?

The objects are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. a 250-gram cup of black tea at a temperature of 120°F
B. a 250-gram cup of black tea at a temperature of 115°F

Answer:","B
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.The two cups of black tea have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 115°F cup of black tea is colder than the 120°F cup of black tea, it has less thermal energy."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
rust forming on a metal gate
burning food on a stove

Choices:
A. Both are caused by heating.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","D
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Burning food on a stove is a chemical change. When the food burns, the type of matter in it changes. The food turns black and gives off smoke.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Burning is caused by heating. But rust forming on a metal gate is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

B. yes

Answer:","A
A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.
There are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:
Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily since we have a concert in two weeks.This is not a run-on sentence. It is not formed from two sentences that have been run together without appropriate punctuation.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
erosion caused by wind
ice melting in a cup

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","D
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Erosion caused by wind is a physical change. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock. But the pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter.
Ice melting in a cup is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The solid ice becomes liquid, but it is still made of water.

The time period after the Civil War is usually called Reconstruction. What does it mean to reconstruct something?

Choices:
A. to criticize something
B. to destroy something
C. to forget something entirely
D. to build something again

Answer:","D
The prefix re- means ""again."" The word construct means ""to build."" So, reconstruct means ""to build something again."" The Confederate States were in the South. The border states were Southern states that did not join the Confederacy. In 1861, the Civil War started when 11 Southern states seceded, or withdrew from the country. The seceded states tried to form a new country called the Confederate States of America. In 1865, the Confederate states lost the Civil War. During Reconstruction, Americans debated how to bring the Confederate states back into the United States' political and economic systems."

Question:
Two blocks of iron have the same temperature but different masses. Which block has more thermal energy?

Hint:
The objects are made of the same type of matter.

Choices:
A. the block of iron with less mass
B. the block of iron with more mass

Answer:","B
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two blocks of iron have the same temperature and are made of the same type of matter. So, the block of iron with more mass has more thermal energy."

Question:
Complete the statement.
Potassium chloride is ().

Hint:
Potassium chloride can be added to food as a substitute for table salt. The chemical formula for potassium chloride is KCl.

Choices:
A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Answer:","A
There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether potassium chloride is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for potassium chloride, KCl, contains two atomic symbols: K for potassium and Cl for chlorine. So, the formula tells you that potassium chloride is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since potassium chloride is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, potassium chloride is a compound."

Question:
The city of Norwood has been one of the world's biggest makers of cough drops for many years. But last month, Norwood's cough drop factories were destroyed by floods. What will probably happen to the overall supply of cough drops?

Choices:
A. The supply will probably go down.
B. The supply will probably go up.

Answer:","A
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.Floods destroyed the cough drop factories in Norwood. The number of producers of cough drops went down. So, the supply of cough drops will probably go down."

Question:
Compare the motion of two cars. Which car was moving at a lower speed?

Choices:
A. a car that moved 445miles in 10hours
B. a car that moved 170miles in 10hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.Look at the distance each car moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One car moved 170 miles in 10 hours.
The other car moved 445 miles in 10 hours.
Notice that each car spent the same amount of time moving. The car that moved 170 miles moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that car must have moved at a lower speed."

Question:
Assume all other forces on the leash are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on the leash?

Hint:
Camilla is walking her dog, Daisy. A squirrel just ran by, and Daisy is pulling forward on the leash with a force of 250N. Camilla is pulling backward on the leash with a force of 180N.

Choices:
A. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the leash.
B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the leash.

Answer:","A
A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.To determine if there is a net force on the leash, look at the forces:
Daisy is pulling the leash forward with a force of 250 N.
Camilla is pulling the leash backward with a force of 180 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 250 N and 180 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the leash."

Dakota has green eyes.

Choices:
A. Dakota has green eyes like her biological mother.
B. Dakota and her biological father wear sunglasses when they go outside.
C. Dakota's neighbor has green eyes.

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
ice melting in a cup
dew appearing on grass in the morning

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","C
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Ice melting in a cup is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The solid ice becomes liquid, but it is still made of water.
The links between atoms in the water molecules do not change. So, a different type of matter is not formed.
Dew appearing on grass in the morning is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air touches the cool grass and becomes liquid.
The water vapor changes state to become dew, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Ice melting is caused by heating. But dew appearing on grass is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Dew appears when water vapor in the air condenses into a liquid on the grass. This is caused by cooling. But ice melting is not."

Hint:
Read the text about a person in motion.
Caleb rode an escalator from the first floor to the second floor of a shopping mall.

Choices:
A. increased
B. stayed the same
C. decreased

Answer:","A
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between Caleb and the center of Earth changed.
The second floor is higher than the first floor. As he rode the escalator toward the second floor, the distance between Caleb and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between Caleb and Earth increased as he rode the escalator."

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Dust settling out of the air is a physical change. As the dust settles, or falls, it might land on furniture or the ground. This separates dust particles from the air, but does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But dust settling out of the air is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
What is the mass of a can of soup?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 15 pounds
B. 15 ounces
C. 15 tons

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton.The best estimate for the mass of a can of soup is 15 ounces.
15 pounds and 15 tons are both too heavy."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
I don't trust Professor Powell's findings. Another researcher at her university was caught falsifying data. So, it's likely Professor Powell has, too.

Choices:
A. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
B. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
C. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Professor Powell's research is untrustworthy because someone else at her university was caught falsifying data. However, this isn't necessarily true. The practices of one researcher at a university do not necessarily reflect the practices of another researcher at the same university. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."

What do these two changes have in common?
plants making food from sunlight, air, and water
a penny tarnishing

Choices:
A. Both are caused by heating.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","B
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Plants making food is a chemical change. Plants use energy from sunlight to change air and water into food. The food is sugar. Sugar is a different type of matter than air or water.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Choices:
A. a blue whale that moved 55miles in 5hours
B. a blue whale that moved 40miles in 5hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.Look at the distance each blue whale moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One blue whale moved 40 miles in 5 hours.
The other blue whale moved 55 miles in 5 hours.
Notice that each blue whale spent the same amount of time moving. The blue whale that moved 40 miles moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that blue whale must have moved at a lower speed."

Answer:","B
Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.
How do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.

Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.

a stove
a pot

Choices:
A. Does milk chocolate or dark chocolate melt faster when heated on the stove?
B. Does dark chocolate or white chocolate melt faster when heated on the stove?
C. Does milk chocolate melt faster when heated in a microwave or on a stove?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader.This sentence uses a metaphor:
Mr. Casey's long legs were sunflower stalks.
The words legs and sunflower stalks are compared without the word like or as.
This sentence uses a simile:
Mr. Casey's legs were as long as sunflower stalks.
The words legs and sunflower stalks are compared using the word as."

Question:
Is this a run-on sentence?
White chocolate does not contain cocoa solids, it contains milk solids, cocoa butter, sugar, and flavorings such as vanilla.

Choices:
A. no
B. yes

Answer:","B
A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.
There are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:
Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
I don't give tests to my students because good students will study the material regardless, and bad students won't study the material even for a test.

Choices:
A. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
B. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
C. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that there are two types of students: good students who will study without the incentive of a test, and bad students who won't study even with the incentive of the test. However, this argument artificially restricts the types of students to just two extremes. For example, there may be some students who would study if they had a test, but who wouldn't study if they didn't have a test. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy."

They have eight legs.
They have an exoskeleton.
They have no antennae. Observe the animals and read the descriptions.

Choices:
A. Female wolf spiders carry their young on their backs! If you look closely at the picture, you can see small wolf spiders on their mother's back. The adult and baby wolf spiders each have an exoskeleton and eight legs. They do not have antennae.
B. Trichina worms have soft, thin bodies. They have a cylindrical shape and do not have limbs. Trichina worms are not made up of segments. They can infect and feed off of humans, pigs, and other mammals.

Answer:","A
Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.
How do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.
Arachnids have the following traits:
They have eight legs.
They have an exoskeleton.
They have no antennae.
Compare each animal's traits to the group's traits. Select the animal with traits similar to the group's traits.

Question:
Which object has more thermal energy?

Hint:
The objects are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. a 200-gram mug of cocoa at a temperature of 155°F
B. a 200-gram mug of cocoa at a temperature of 115°F

Answer:","A
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.The two mugs of cocoa have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 155°F mug of cocoa is hotter than the 115°F mug of cocoa, it has more thermal energy."

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
water evaporating from a puddle
rain forming in a cloud

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","A
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Rain forming in a cloud is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air condenses into tiny droplets of liquid water. These droplets make up a cloud. When there is enough water in the air, the droplets will fall as rain.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But rain forming in a cloud is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Rain begins to form when water vapor in the air becomes liquid water. This is caused by cooling. But water evaporating from a puddle is not."

Question:
Based on this information, what is this pea plant's genotype for the pod shape gene?

Hint:
This passage describes the pod shape trait in pea plants:

In a group of pea plants, some individuals have inflated pods and others have constricted pods. In this group, the gene for the pod shape trait has two alleles. The allele D is for inflated pods, and the allele d is for constricted pods.
A certain pea plant from this group has inflated pods. This plant has one allele for inflated pods and one allele for constricted pods.

Choices:
A. Dd
B. inflated pods

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The pea plant has one allele for inflated pods (D) and one allele for constricted pods (d). So, the plant's genotype for the pod shape gene is Dd."

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.The better estimate for the length of a school bus is 13 meters.

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Question:
Which drop of dish soap has less thermal energy?

Hint:
Two drops of dish soap are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. the colder drop of dish soap
B. the hotter drop of dish soap

Answer:","A
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two drops of dish soap are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder drop of dish soap has less thermal energy."

Question:
Why might a person have a limb amputated?

Hint:
If a person's body is damaged, the body can often heal itself. But sometimes, disease or injury can cause damage that is too severe to heal. When a limb is too severely damaged to heal, it may need to be amputated, or removed.
For example, a doctor can treat an infected limb with medicine. But if the infection does not go away, it can spread to the rest of the person's body. To stop the infection from spreading, the infected limb may need to be amputated.
In other cases, when a limb is badly injured, the skin, bones, muscles, and nerves may be severely damaged. If the damaged tissue cannot heal, it may die. The severely damaged or dead tissue then needs to be amputated.

Choices:
A. After an accident, the limb is too badly injured to heal.

This passage describes the antenna type trait in fruit flies:

In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have mutated antennae and others have normal antennae. In this group, the gene for the antenna type trait has two alleles. The allele A is for mutated antennae, and the allele a is for normal antennae.
A certain fruit fly from this group has mutated antennae. This fly has one allele for mutated antennae and one allele for normal antennae.

Choices:
A. Aa
B. mutated antennae

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The fruit fly's observable version of the antenna type trait is mutated antennae. So, the fly's phenotype for the antenna type trait is mutated antennae."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Leon must not have enjoyed the casserole, or he would have asked for a second serving.

Choices:
A. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
B. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
C. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist

Answer:","C
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that if Leon enjoyed the casserole, then he would have eaten more. However, Leon could have enjoyed the casserole without wanting a second serving. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy."

Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton.The best estimate for the mass of a trumpet is 2 pounds.

Hint:
In a group of jaguars, some individuals have a black coat and others have a spotted coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A).
Hari is a jaguar from this group. Hari has the homozygous genotype aa for the coat pattern gene.

Choices:
A. a black coat
B. a spotted coat

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Hari's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa. Hari's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for a spotted coat. So, Hari's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Hari's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Hari's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Hari's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat."

Compare the motion of two buses. Which bus was moving at a higher speed?

Choices:
A. a bus that moved 880kilometers in 10hours
B. a bus that moved 850kilometers in 10hours

Answer:","A
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed.Look at the distance each bus moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One bus moved 880 kilometers in 10 hours.
The other bus moved 850 kilometers in 10 hours.
Notice that each bus spent the same amount of time moving. The bus that moved 880 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that bus must have moved at a higher speed."

Which sentence is more formal?

Choices:
A. Peterson Electronics has a reputation for responding quickly to all customer concerns and questions.
B. Peterson Electronics has a reputation for responding real quick to customer concerns and questions.

Answer:","A
Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples
slang | cool, awesome
idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store
contractions | can't, won't
Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses conversational language (real quick).
The first sentence uses formal language in place of the conversational language, so it is more formal overall."

Choices:
A. The supply probably went up.
B. The supply probably went down.

Answer:","B
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.When four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, the number of suppliers went down. There were fewer stores selling men's shirts. So, the supply of men's shirts probably went down."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
water boiling on a stove
ice melting in a glass

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","B
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Water boiling on the stove is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Ice melting in a glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The solid ice becomes liquid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not made.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.

The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Precious's genotype for the fur type gene is FF. Precious's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for straight fur. So, Precious's phenotype for the fur type trait must be straight fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Precious's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for curly fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Precious's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Precious's phenotype for the fur type trait must be straight fur."

Question:
Which text uses the word disinterested in its traditional sense?

Choices:
A. As a teacher of American history, Mr. McDowell tries to remain disinterested when discussing controversial issues, giving equal attention and consideration to each major viewpoint.
B. As an experienced teacher of American history, Mr. McDowell believes that playing history-based trivia games will revive even the most disinterested of students.

Answer:","A
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The first text uses disinterested in its traditional sense: unbiased or impartial.
As a teacher of American history, Mr. McDowell tries to remain disinterested when discussing controversial issues, giving equal attention and consideration to each major viewpoint.
The second text uses disinterested in its nontraditional sense: uninterested or indifferent.
As an experienced teacher of American history, Mr. McDowell believes that playing history-based trivia games will revive even the most disinterested of students.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word disinterested because it is considered more standard."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
shaking up salad dressing
breaking a piece of glass

Choices:
A. Both are caused by heating.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","C
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Shaking up salad dressing is a physical change. The different parts mix together, but they are still made of the same type of matter.
Breaking a piece of glass is a physical change. The glass gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.

Question:
Based on this information, what is Jupiter's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?

Hint:
In a group of jaguars, some individuals have a black coat and others have a spotted coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A).
Jupiter is a jaguar from this group. Jupiter has the homozygous genotype AA for the coat pattern gene.

Choices:
A. a spotted coat
B. a black coat

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Jupiter's genotype for the coat pattern gene is AA. Jupiter's genotype of AA has only A allelles. The A allele is for a black coat. So, Jupiter's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Jupiter's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Jupiter's genotype of AA has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Jupiter's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a black coat."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
beating an egg
mixing lettuce and salad dressing

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","D
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Beating an egg is a physical change. Beating an egg mixes together the egg white, egg yolk, and some air. But mixing them together does not form a different type of matter.
Mixing lettuce and salad dressing is a physical change. Together, the salad and dressing make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.

Two baked potatoes have the same temperature but different masses. Which potato has more thermal energy?

Hint:
The objects are made of the same type of matter.

Choices:
A. the baked potato with more mass
B. the baked potato with less mass

Answer:","A
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two baked potatoes have the same temperature and are made of the same type of matter. So, the baked potato with more mass has more thermal energy."

Hint:
Marcy has a small vegetable garden, which includes a compost pile of food scraps. She notices that some of the squash plants growing next to the compost pile grow differently than squash plants that are farther away. She wonders what factors affect how her squash plants grow. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
one type of squash seeds
four large clay pots
soil
a compost pile
water

Choices:
A. If squash seeds and tomato seeds are planted with compost, which type of plant grows larger?
B. Do squash plants grow larger if the seeds are planted with compost or without compost?
C. Do squash plants grow larger if the seeds are planted in small pots or in large pots?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
The most delicious avocados in the U.S. are grown in California because California avocados have the best taste.

Choices:
A. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
B. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
C. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself

Answer:","C
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that avocados from California are the most delicious because they taste the best. However, the ""evidence"" is just a restatement of the claim itself. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as circular reasoning."

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits.People are not born knowing how to ride a bicycle. Instead, many people learn how to ride. So, riding a bicycle is an acquired trait."

Question:
Which object has less thermal energy?

Hint:
The objects are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. a 125-gram glass of grape juice at a temperature of 15°C
B. a 125-gram glass of grape juice at a temperature of 25°C

Answer:","A
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.The two glasses of grape juice have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 15°C glass of grape juice is colder than the 25°C glass of grape juice, it has less thermal energy."

Question:
What is the volume of a coffee pot?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 12 fluid ounces
B. 12 cups
C. 12 gallons

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon.The best estimate for the volume of a coffee pot is 12 cups.
12 fluid ounces is too little and 12 gallons is too much."
"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Select the solid.

Choices:
A. air inside a balloon
B. wet paint
C. tent

Answer:","C
Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a shape of its own.
Some solids can be bent or broken easily. Others are hard to bend or break.
A glass cup is a solid. A sock is also a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it takes the shape of its container.
Think about pouring a liquid from a cup into a bottle. The shape of the liquid is different in the cup than in the bottle. But the liquid still takes up the same amount of space.
Juice is a liquid. Honey is also a liquid.
When matter is a gas, it spreads out to fill a space.
Many gases are invisible. So, you can’t see them. Air is a gas.The air inside a balloon is a gas. A gas spreads out to fill a space. The air inside a balloon spreads out to fill all the space in the balloon. If the balloon pops, the air will spread out to fill a much larger space.
A tent is a solid. You can fold a tent or spread it out. But it will still have a size and shape of its own.
Wet paint is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour wet paint out of a can, the paint will change shape. But the wet paint will still take up the same amount of space."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
compost rotting
a piece of apple turning brown

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","D
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Compost forms from the remains of plants and animals, such as vegetable scraps and egg shells. Compost rotting is a chemical change. As the compost rots, it breaks down and turns into a different type of matter.
A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Farid investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Farid is baking a pie. He notices that the crust burns before the pie is fully cooked. He wonders what factors affect whether a pie crust will burn in the oven. So, he decides to design an experiment. He has the following supplies available:
ingredients for pumpkin pie filling
ingredients for apple pie filling
two pie crusts made with white flour
a glass pie pan
an aluminum pie pan
an oven

Choices:
A. Does a pie crust made with white flour burn more quickly when the pie is cooked in a glass pan or in an aluminum pan?
B. Do pie crusts made with white flour burn less quickly when covered with aluminum foil or when left uncovered?
C. Does a pie crust made with white flour burn more quickly than a pie crust made with whole wheat flour?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"
"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Complete the sentence.
Cellular respiration is a ().

Choices:
A. physical change
B. chemical change

Answer:","B
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.Cellular respiration is a chemical change. Cells use oxygen to break down sugar. Breaking the chemical bonds in sugar molecules releases energy that a cell can use.
The atoms from the broken molecules then combine to form different molecules such as carbon dioxide and water. These molecules are different types of matter than sugar and oxygen."

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Maura has no school spirit—she never comes to any of our football games.

Choices:
A. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
B. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Maura doesn't have school spirit, because she doesn't go to football games. However, there may be a number of reasons why Maura doesn't go to football games. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy."

Answer:","B
Poetry is a special kind of writing. It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.
A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel
In vest of shining white,
In coat of silver gray,
And vest of shining white.
—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, ""The Flying Squirrel""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring""This poem uses end rhyme. Its rhymes come at the end of its lines.
With the sky above me, the earth below.

Last year, 50,000 people lived in the city of Oak Grove. But since then, 8,000 people have moved away. What probably happened to the overall supply of houses for sale in Oak Grove?

Choices:
A. The supply probably went up.
B. The supply probably went down.

Answer:","A
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.The population of Oak Grove fell by 8,000 people. Many of the people who have left are probably trying to sell their houses. Since more people are trying to sell their houses, the number of suppliers of houses for sale in Oak Grove has gone up.

Answer:","B
Poets often use the sounds of words to create interesting effects and to express moods and emotions. Understanding these elements of poetry can help you better interpret and appreciate poetic forms.
Anaphora is the repetition of words or sequences of words at the beginning of multiple phrases, sentences, or lines.
Out of the cradle endlessly rocking,
Out of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,
Out of the Ninth-month midnight
—From Walt Whitman, ""Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds. Often, assonance can create rhymes or near-rhymes within lines.
I wandered lonely as a Cloud
That floats on high o'er Vales and Hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host of golden Daffodils.
—From William Wordsworth, ""I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud""
Meter is a poem's rhythm, or the pattern of strong and weak syllables. Strong syllables are stressed, while weak syllables are unstressed.
A poem has an iambic meter when the beat sounds like da-DUM. A weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Occasionally, a line may begin with a strong syllable.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
A poem has a trochaic meter when the beat sounds like DUM-da. A strong syllable is followed by a weak syllable. Occasionally, a line may end in a strong syllable.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
—From Edgar Allen Poe, ""The Raven""
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.This poem uses onomatopoeia. It uses language that sounds like what it talks about.
Seas of glittering spears arise."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Kiki's phenotype for the whisker type trait?

Hint:
In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight whiskers and others have curved whiskers. In this group, the gene for the whisker type trait has two alleles. The allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H).
Kiki is a Syrian hamster from this group. Kiki has the heterozygous genotype Hh for the whisker type gene.

Choices:
A. straight whiskers
B. curved whiskers

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Kiki's phenotype for the whisker type trait. First, consider the alleles in Kiki's genotype for the whisker type gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Kiki's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Kiki's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be straight whiskers."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
a banana getting ripe on the counter
saliva breaking down a piece of bread

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","D
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
A banana getting ripe on the counter is a chemical change. As a banana ripens, the type of matter in it changes. The peel changes color and the inside becomes softer and sweeter.
Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is a chemical change. Bread is made up mostly of a chemical called starch. Saliva breaks the bonds between atoms in the starch molecules.
The atoms then link together to form smaller, simpler molecules of sugar. The sugar is a different type of matter than the starch.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Since Hampton College receives more applications for admission than Greenpoint University, Hampton College is evidently a better school.

Choices:
A. hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations
B. slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences
C. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct

Answer:","C
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Hampton College is better than Greenpoint University because Hampton College receives more applications. However, the popularity of a school does not necessarily indicate its quality. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as the bandwagon fallacy."

Question:
Which statement describes the sailboat's motion?

Hint:
A sailboat is speeding up as a gust of wind catches the sail.

Choices:
A. The sailboat is accelerating.
B. The sailboat has a constant velocity.

Answer:","A
An object's velocity describes its speed and its direction.
An object has a constant velocity when neither its speed nor its direction is changing. So, an object has a constant velocity when the object is:
moving in a straight line at a constant speed, or
remaining motionless.
If an object does not have a constant velocity, the object is accelerating. An object is accelerating when either its speed or its direction is changing. So, an object is accelerating when the object is:
speeding up,
slowing down, or
changing direction.The sailboat is speeding up. So, the sailboat is accelerating."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
a piece of apple turning brown
compost rotting

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","A
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.
Compost forms from the remains of plants and animals, such as vegetable scraps and egg shells. Compost rotting is a chemical change. As the compost rots, it breaks down and turns into a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.

Phosphorus tribromide is ().

Hint:
Phosphorus tribromide is used to make certain types of medicine. The chemical formula for phosphorus tribromide is PBr3.

Choices:
A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Answer:","A
There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether phosphorus tribromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for phosphorus tribromide, PBr3, contains two atomic symbols: P for phosphorus and Br for bromine. So, the formula tells you that phosphorus tribromide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since phosphorus tribromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, phosphorus tribromide is a compound."

Question:
What information supports the conclusion that Denise inherited this trait?

Hint:
Read the description of a trait.
Denise has straight hair.

Choices:
A. Denise's biological mother often wears her straight hair in a ponytail.
B. Denise's biological parents have red hair. Denise also has red hair.
C. Denise's neighbor also has straight hair.

Answer:","A
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Question:
Based on this information, what is this muskmelon plant's phenotype for the fruit taste trait?

Hint:
In a group of muskmelon plants, some individuals have sour fruit and others have sweet fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit taste trait has two alleles. The allele F is for sour fruit, and the allele f is for sweet fruit.
A certain muskmelon plant from this group has sour fruit. This plant has two alleles for sour fruit.

Choices:
A. sour fruit
B. FF

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The muskmelon plant's observable version of the fruit taste trait is sour fruit. So, the plant's phenotype for the fruit taste trait is sour fruit."

Question:
Which of the following is better evidence that Ellen's kinetic energy changed?

Hint:
There are many types of energy. One type is kinetic energy, which is the energy an object has when it is moving.
Read the passage about a bike ride. Think about the kinetic energy of the person riding the bike.
Ellen was training for a bike race. One afternoon, she grabbed her helmet and took her bike out to the street. She got on the bike and started to pedal, pushing hard to start moving forward.

Choices:
A. When Ellen started pedaling her bike, she began moving along the street.
B. When Ellen got on her bike, her feet were no longer touching the ground.

Answer:","A
The kinetic energy of an object depends on the object's speed. So, a change in Ellen's speed is evidence of a change in her kinetic energy.
This statement shows that Ellen's speed changed:
When Ellen started pedaling her bike, she began moving along the street.
This statement does not show that Ellen's speed changed:

Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. Robert showed them the error on his receipt, and he received a refund.
B. Robert showed the customer service representatives the error on his receipt, and he received a refund.

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun them is used without its antecedent.

The movers lift the boxes at the same speed. Which box is lifted with a larger force?

Hint:
Two movers are putting heavy boxes into their truck. The boxes are the same shape and size. Each mover lifts one box up into the truck at a time.

Choices:
A. a box holding 40 pounds
B. a box holding 30 pounds

Answer:","A
A force is a push or a pull.
A force can make an object start moving or stop an object that is moving. A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.
Forces can be different sizes.
Think about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object.Look for the box that is heavier.
A box holding 40 pounds is heavier than a box holding 30 pounds. So, the box holding 40 pounds needs a larger force to start moving upward at the same speed as the other box."

C. simple
D. compound-complex

Answer:","B
A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence.
the oranges on our tree are ripe
The clause can stand alone. It is independent.

The clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.
A simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.
Ben and I spent all day relaxing by the pool.
Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.
In the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.
Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw the flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard a rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
baking a loaf of bread
melting glass

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","C
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. The type of matter in the dough changes when it is baked. The dough turns into bread!
Melting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The glass changes from solid to liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Melting glass is a physical change. But baking bread is not.
Both are chemical changes.
Baking bread is a chemical change. But melting glass is not.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Using only these supplies, which question can Edmond investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
After Edmond cleans up a spill, he hangs a wet cloth towel in the laundry room. Two hours later, he notices that the towel has partially dried. He wonders what factors affect how cloth dries. So, he decides to design an experiment. He has the following supplies available:
two identical white cloth towels
water
a clothesline in the laundry room
a clothesline in the backyard

Choices:
A. Do cloth towels dry faster if they are hung in the laundry room or in the backyard?
B. Does a small cloth towel or a large cloth towel dry faster when hung in the backyard?
C. When hung in the laundry room, do black cloth towels or white cloth towels dry more quickly?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Honey's observable version of the fur length trait is long fur. So, Honey's phenotype for the fur length trait is long fur."

How long is an eyelash?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 8 kilometers
B. 8 meters
C. 8 centimeters
D. 8 millimeters

Answer:","D
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.
A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length.The best estimate for the length of an eyelash is 8 millimeters.

Does the sentence use a simile or a metaphor?
Tracy went down the slide face-first, like a penguin.

Choices:
A. metaphor
B. simile

Answer:","B
Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader.Tracy went down the slide face-first, like a penguin.

Question:
Use the evidence in the text to select the photosynthetic organism.

Choices:
A. Common fig plants are grown around the world for their fruit. The fig plants use carbon dioxide and water to make food.
B. Double-eyed fig parrots live in the forests of Australia and New Guinea. These parrots rely on figs and other plants for food.

Answer:","A
Organisms that carry out photosynthesis are called photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, these organisms use light energy to turn water and carbon dioxide into sugars and oxygen.
Photosynthetic organisms also often have the following characteristics:
They are producers, which are organisms that make their own food inside their cells. Producers don't usually eat other organisms.
Their cells contain chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are cell parts where photosynthesis occurs.
Their chloroplasts often contain chlorophyll, which is green. Chlorophyll captures energy from sunlight to power photosynthesis.
They use the sugars they make during photosynthesis as food. This food provides the organisms with the energy they need to live.This organism is photosynthetic:
The text tells you that common fig plants use carbon dioxide and water to make food. This is evidence that the common fig is a photosynthetic organism.

Choices:
A. simple
B. compound-complex
C. complex
D. compound

Answer:","A
A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence.

Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.
In the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.
Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw the flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard a rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.

Which sentence is more formal?

Choices:
A. Chen Electronics has a reputation for responding quickly to all customer concerns and questions.
B. Chen Electronics has a reputation for responding real quick to customer concerns and questions.

Answer:","A
Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples
slang | cool, awesome
idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store
contractions | can't, won't
Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses conversational language (real quick).
The first sentence uses formal language in place of the conversational language, so it is more formal overall."

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
mixing sand and water
sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","D
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Mixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.
The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that the water balloon's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth () as the water balloon fell toward Dale.

Hint:
Read the text about an object in motion.
Kimi dropped a water balloon off a balcony. The water balloon fell toward her friend Dale, who was standing below the balcony.

Choices:
A. decreased
B. stayed the same
C. increased

Answer:","A
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth changed.
Dale was lower than the balcony. As the water balloon fell toward Dale, the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreased as the water balloon fell toward Dale."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
You should never let someone borrow something from you. If you do, then everyone will just start taking your things without asking!

Choices:
A. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
B. slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences
C. ad hominem: an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that letting one person borrow something from you means that everyone will take your things without asking. However, just because you let one person borrow something from you, it does not necessarily mean everyone will change their behavior toward you. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as the slippery slope fallacy."

Question:
Is there a surplus or a shortage of new cars?

Hint:
A car dealership has 20 brand-new cars. Each car costs $28,000. At that price, there are 40 people who want to buy one.

Choices:
A. surplus
B. shortage

Answer:","B
There is a surplus if there is too much for sale at a given price.
There is a shortage if there is not enough for sale at a given price.
Surpluses and shortages usually happen when people who are selling goods or services charge too much or too little.
When the price is too high, consumers will not want to buy much of the good or service. The quantity demanded will be less than the quantity supplied. So, there will be a surplus.
When the price is too low, too many consumers will want to buy the good or service. The quantity demanded will be more than the quantity supplied. So, there will be a shortage.At the current price, there are not enough cars for sale. There are 20 cars for sale, but 40 people want to buy one.
So, there is a shortage of cars."

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits.Humans do not choose their skin color. Babies get their skin color from their parents. So, Josh's skin color is an inherited trait."

Question:
Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. The blouse looks lovely with that skirt, but it costs too much.
B. Although the blouse costs too much, it does look lovely with that skirt.

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
All of my friends are coming to my birthday party. If Kira doesn't, she might as well tell me that she doesn't like me.

Choices:
A. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
B. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that if Kira doesn't go to the speaker's birthday party, it means that she hates the speaker. However, there may be a number of reasons why Kira wouldn't go to the party. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy."

Question:
Select the elementary substance.

Choices:
A. hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
B. cyclopropane (C3H6)
C. silver (Ag)

Answer:","C
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for cyclopropane contains two symbols: C for carbon and H for hydrogen. So, cyclopropane is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, cyclopropane is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for silver contains one symbol: Ag. So, silver is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, silver is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for hydrogen sulfide contains two symbols: H for hydrogen and S for sulfur. So, hydrogen sulfide is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, hydrogen sulfide is a compound, not an elementary substance."

Question:
Select the elementary substance.

Choices:
A. pyrite (FeS2)
B. nickel (Ni)
C. chloromethane (CH3Cl)

Answer:","B
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for pyrite contains two symbols: Fe for iron and S for sulfur. So, pyrite is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, pyrite is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for chloromethane contains three symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, and Cl for chlorine. So, chloromethane is made of three chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, chloromethane is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for nickel contains one symbol: Ni. So, nickel is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, nickel is an elementary substance."

Question:
Compare the motion of two bats. Which bat was moving at a lower speed?

Choices:
A. a bat that moved 30miles in 5hours
B. a bat that moved 40miles in 5hours

Answer:","A
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.Look at the distance each bat moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One bat moved 30 miles in 5 hours.
The other bat moved 40 miles in 5 hours.
Notice that each bat spent the same amount of time moving. The bat that moved 30 miles moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that bat must have moved at a lower speed."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
a slice of banana turning brown
chicken cooking in an oven

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","B
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The part of the banana in contact with the air reacts with oxygen and turns into a different type of matter.
Cooking chicken is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the chicken to change. Cooked chicken and raw chicken are different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking is caused by heating. But a slice of banana turning brown is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Which text uses the word literally in its traditional sense?

Choices:
A. Jasmine adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally hundreds of years old.
B. Jasmine adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally a million years old.

Answer:","A
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The first text uses literally in its traditional sense: in a factual, non-exaggerated way.
Jasmine adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally hundreds of years old.
The second text uses literally in its nontraditional sense: nearly or in effect (often exaggerated). The bridge is old, but it is not actually a million years old.
Jasmine adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally a million years old.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word literally because it is generally considered incorrect."

Question:
Does the sentence use a simile or a metaphor?
My little brother is as sweet as pie.

Choices:
A. metaphor
B. simile

Answer:","B
Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader.My little brother is as sweet as pie.
The words brother and pie are compared using the word as. So, the sentence uses a simile."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Carla investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Carla has a garden that is sometimes visited by deer. She notices that the deer eat some plants in her garden more than others. She wonders what factors affect which plants the deer eat. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
a garlic spray used to keep garden pests away
four tomato plants
four bean plants

Choices:
A. Do the deer eat fewer leaves from bean plants sprayed with coffee spray than from unsprayed bean plants?
B. Do the deer eat fewer leaves from bean plants sprayed with garlic spray than from unsprayed bean plants?
C. Do the deer eat more leaves from tomato plants or from squash plants?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
In the 1970s, several countries in the Middle East decided to pump less oil from their oil wells. Oil is often made into gasoline. What happened to the world's overall supply of gasoline?

Choices:
A. The supply went up.
B. The supply went down.

Answer:","B
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.Oil is a resource for gasoline. When oil became more expensive, it was harder to get. There was less of it that could be made into gasoline. So, the supply of gasoline went down."

Which statement describes the antelope's motion?

Hint:
An antelope is running faster and faster away from a hungry lion.

Choices:
A. The antelope has a constant velocity.
B. The antelope is accelerating.

Answer:","B
An object's velocity describes its speed and its direction.
An object has a constant velocity when neither its speed nor its direction is changing. So, an object has a constant velocity when the object is:
moving in a straight line at a constant speed, or
remaining motionless.
If an object does not have a constant velocity, the object is accelerating. An object is accelerating when either its speed or its direction is changing. So, an object is accelerating when the object is:
speeding up,
slowing down, or
changing direction.The antelope is speeding up. So, the antelope is accelerating."

Question:
Select the one animal that has all of the crustacean traits listed above.

Hint:
Crustaceans are a group of animals with similar traits. The following traits can be used to identify crustaceans:
They have two pairs of antennae.
They have an exoskeleton. Observe the animals and read the descriptions.

A. Earthworms live in soil and have no limbs. Their bodies are soft, cylindrical, and made up of many segments.
B. Blue crabs are omnivores. Omnivores are animals that are adapted to eat both plants and animals. Blue crabs have an exoskeleton and two pairs of antennae.

Answer:","B
Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.
How do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.
Crustaceans have the following traits:
They have two pairs of antennae.
They have an exoskeleton.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
The rise of video games has led to more computer science PhDs, as shown by the fact that the number of PhD degrees in computer science increased as video games became more popular.

Choices:
A. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
B. slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences
C. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other

Answer:","C
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that a rise in video games has increased the number of PhD degrees in computer science. However, this isn't necessarily true. There could be common explanation for both increases. For example, increased access to computers could be responsible for both the rise in video games and the increase in computer science PhDs. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as false causation."

What is the volume of a carton of orange juice?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 2 liters
B. 2 milliliters

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters.The better estimate for the volume of a carton of orange juice is 2 liters.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, ice melting is a physical change. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.Grilling a hamburger is a chemical change. Heat from the grill causes the matter in the meat to change. Cooked meat and raw meat are different types of matter."

A certain rose plant from this group does not have thorns. This plant has two alleles for not having thorns.

Choices:
A. rr
B. not having thorns

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The rose plant's observable version of the thorns trait is not having thorns. So, the plant's phenotype for the thorns trait is not having thorns."

Question:
Select the liquid.

Choices:
A. water from a faucet
B. stone statue
C. book
D. arrowhead

Answer:","A
Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.An arrowhead is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. An arrowhead is made of rock.
The water from a faucet is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you put water from a faucet into a container, the water will take the shape of that container. But the water will still take up the same amount of space.
A book is a solid. When you read a book, you bend the spine and turn the pages. But the book still has a shape of its own.

Question:
Based on this information, what is this tomato plant's phenotype for the leaf type trait?

Hint:
This passage describes the leaf type trait in tomato plants:

In a group of tomato plants, some individuals have regular leaves and others have potato leaves. In this group, the gene for the leaf type trait has two alleles. The allele L is for regular leaves, and the allele l is for potato leaves.
A certain tomato plant from this group has potato leaves. This plant has two alleles for potato leaves.

Choices:
A. potato leaves
B. ll

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The tomato plant's observable version of the leaf type trait is potato leaves. So, the plant's phenotype for the leaf type trait is potato leaves."

What is the source of the allusion in the sentence below?
Looking at his life, we couldn't help but see Grayson as a Job-like figure.

Choices:
A. the Bible
B. Roman history

Answer:","A
An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux.The source of the allusion Job is the Bible.
In the Bible, Job remains faithful and loyal to God, even after the unjust loss of his possessions, family, and health.
The allusion Job means someone who patiently endures adversity."

The Fifth Amendment talks about the rights of people who are accused of crimes. For example, anyone accused of a crime has the right to remain silent. The amendment also says that no person can be put on trial for ().

Choices:
A. a crime he or she did not commit
B. breaking a law he or she didn't know about

Answer:","C
The Fifth Amendment says that anyone accused of a crime has the right to remain silent. The amendment also says that no person can be put on trial for the same crime more than once. Putting a person on trial for the same crime twice is called double jeopardy. To be in jeopardy is to be in danger of losing something, such as life or freedom. In the United States, no one can ever be put in double jeopardy. Part of the text of the Fifth Amendment is below. It never uses the phrase ""double jeopardy.""

Question:
Which sentence is more formal?

Choices:
A. The awesome band Prehistoric Playground has a gig at McCarthy Hall tonight.
B. The band Prehistoric Playground is performing at McCarthy Hall tonight.

Answer:","B
Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples
slang | cool, awesome
idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store
contractions | can't, won't
Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The first sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses slang (awesome, gig).
The second sentence uses formal language in place of the slang, so it is more formal overall."

Question:
Does the sentence use a simile or a metaphor?
Mrs. Robertson is an owl, working at night and sleeping during the day.

Choices:
A. metaphor
B. simile

Answer:","A
Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader.Mrs. Robertson is an owl, working at night and sleeping during the day.
The words Mrs. Robertson and owl are compared without the word like or as. So, the sentence uses a metaphor."

Question:
Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. When Molly and her sister flew to Hawaii last month, the airline lost her baggage.
B. The airline lost Molly's baggage when she flew to Hawaii with her sister last month.

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.

Choices:
A. The supply probably went up.
B. The supply probably went down.

Answer:","A
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.The population of Fairview fell by 8,000 people. Many of the people who have left are probably trying to sell their houses. Since more people are trying to sell their houses, the number of suppliers of houses for sale in Fairview has gone up.

Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage.

Question:
Select the solid.

Choices:
A. hair clip
B. water in a fishbowl
C. air inside a raft
D. helium

Answer:","A
Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.The water in a fishbowl is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour water from a fishbowl into a different container, the water will take the shape of that container. But the water will still take up the same amount of space.
A hair clip is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. You can use a hair clip to keep your hair out of your face because the hair clip keeps its shape.
The air inside a raft is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air in a raft expands to fill all the space inside the raft. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the raft.
Helium is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. Helium is lighter than air. So, if you fill a balloon with helium, the balloon will rise. If helium leaks out of the balloon, the helium will expand into the space around the balloon."

Compare the motion of three geese. Which goose was moving at the lowest speed?

Choices:
A. a goose that moved 275miles south in 5hours
B. a goose that moved 155miles west in 5hours
C. a goose that moved 120miles north in 5hours

Answer:","C
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed.Look at the distance each goose moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each goose moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each goose moved for 5 hours. The goose that moved 120 miles moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that goose must have moved at the lowest speed."

Question:
Which word would you find on a dictionary page with the following guide words?
silver - strait

Choices:
A. soil
B. swap

Answer:","A
Guide words appear on each page of a dictionary. They tell you the first word and last word on the page. The other words on the page come between the guide words in alphabetical order.
To put words in alphabetical order, put them in order by their first letters. If the first letters are the same, look at the second letters. If the second letters are the same, look at the third letters, and so on.
If one word is shorter, and there are no more letters to compare, then the shorter word comes first in alphabetical order. For example, be comes before bed.Put the words in alphabetical order.
Since soil is between the guide words silver - strait, it would be found on that page."

Answer:","B
During peer review, you read and respond to a fellow student's writing. While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:
Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?
Voice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?
Sentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?The writer could best improve his or her grammar and mechanics by fixing run-on sentences.
For example, the writer could divide each of the underlined run-on sentences into two complete sentences.

Question:
How long is a potato?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 16 centimeters
B. 16 kilometers
C. 16 millimeters
D. 16 meters

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.
A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length.The best estimate for the length of a potato is 16 centimeters.

Compare the motion of three bicycles. Which bicycle was moving at the highest speed?

Choices:
A. a bicycle that moved 80miles west in 5hours
B. a bicycle that moved 85miles south in 5hours
C. a bicycle that moved 145miles north in 5hours

Answer:","C
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed.Look at the distance each bicycle moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each bicycle moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each bicycle moved for 5 hours. The bicycle that moved 145 miles moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that bicycle must have moved at the highest speed."

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Did Dalton vote for Sofia for school president, or does he hate her for some reason?

Choices:
A. slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences
B. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
C. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Dalton either voted for Sofia or he hates her. However, Dalton could have voted for someone he considers a better candidate while still liking Sofia. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy."

Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits.

Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.

Question:
Which drop of honey has less thermal energy?

Hint:
Two drops of honey are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. the hotter drop of honey
B. the colder drop of honey

Answer:","B
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two drops of honey are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder drop of honey has less thermal energy."

Answer:","B
Plants and animals are living things. Living things are called organisms.
Plants come in many shapes and sizes. Most plants grow in the ground. They might grow leaves, flowers, and fruit. Plants cannot move around on their own like animals can.
Animals also come in many shapes and sizes. Most animals can move around. Animals might run, swim, jump, or fly. Animals eat plants or other organisms for food.A peregrine falcon is an animal. It walks and flies.
A peregrine falcon can fly very fast. It is the fastest animal in the world!
A salmon is an animal. It swims in the water.

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 55 hours
B. 55 seconds

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.

B. red fruit

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

Based on this information, what is Chester's phenotype for the fur texture trait?

Hint:
In a group of dachshund dogs, some individuals have rough fur and others have soft fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for soft fur (f) is recessive to the allele for rough fur (F).
Chester is a dachshund dog from this group. Chester has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene.

Choices:
A. rough fur
B. soft fur

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.

The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Chester's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff. Chester's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for soft fur. So, Chester's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be soft fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Chester's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for soft fur (f) is recessive to the allele for rough fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Chester's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Chester's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be soft fur."

Question:
Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the pea color trait?

Hint:
In a group of pea plants, some individuals have yellow peas and others have green peas. In this group, the gene for the pea color trait has two alleles. The allele for yellow peas (E) is dominant over the allele for green peas (e).
A certain pea plant from this group has the heterozygous genotype Ee for the pea color gene.

Choices:
A. yellow peas
B. green peas

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine the pea plant's phenotype for the pea color trait. First, consider the alleles in the plant's genotype for the pea color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for yellow peas (E) is dominant over the allele for green peas (e). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
The pea plant's genotype of Ee has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the pea color trait must be yellow peas."

"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Select the liquid.

Choices:
A. water in a fishbowl
B. chalk
C. gold bracelet

Answer:","A
Solid and liquid are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a shape of its own.
Some solids can be bent or broken easily. Others are hard to bend or break.
A glass cup is a solid. A sock is also a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it takes the shape of its container.
Think about pouring a liquid from a cup into a bottle. The shape of the liquid is different in the cup than in the bottle. But the liquid still takes up the same amount of space.
Juice is a liquid. Honey is also a liquid."

Question:
What is the volume of a bathtub?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 75 fluid ounces
B. 75 cups
C. 75 gallons

Answer:","C
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon.The best estimate for the volume of a bathtub is 75 gallons.
75 fluid ounces and 75 cups are both too little."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
In this election, we've seen the highest voter turnout ever recorded. If you have any doubts about Jacob Trevino's qualifications, just look at how many people have come out to vote for him.

Choices:
A. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
B. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Jacob Trevino is the most qualified candidate, because so many voters turned out to vote. However, even though many people voted for him, that doesn't necessarily mean that Jacob Trevino is the most qualified candidate. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as the bandwagon fallacy."

Question:
Which text uses the word unique in its traditional sense?

Choices:
A. Jon custom ordered his unique coffee table from a master craftsman in Lancaster.
B. Jon bought his unique coffee table from a factory outlet store in Lancaster.

Answer:","A
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The first text uses unique in its traditional sense: being the only one of its kind.
Jon custom ordered his unique coffee table from a master craftsman in Lancaster.
The second text uses unique in its nontraditional sense: interesting or unusual. Jon's coffee table is an interesting style, but it was made in a factory and is probably not actually one of a kind.
Jon bought his unique coffee table from a factory outlet store in Lancaster.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word unique because it is considered more standard."

Answer:","A
Poetry is a special kind of writing. It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.
A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel
In vest of shining white,
In coat of silver gray,
And vest of shining white.
—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, ""The Flying Squirrel""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring""This poem uses end rhyme. Its rhymes come at the end of its lines.
Which may be the chosen spot."

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Savannah investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Savannah has a small vegetable garden, which includes a compost pile of food scraps. She notices that some of the squash plants growing next to the compost pile grow differently than squash plants that are farther away. She wonders what factors affect how her squash plants grow. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
one type of squash seeds
four large clay pots
soil
a compost pile
water

Choices:
A. Do squash plants grow larger if the seeds are planted in small pots or in large pots?
B. If squash seeds and tomato seeds are planted with compost, which type of plant grows larger?
C. Do squash plants grow larger if the seeds are planted with compost or without compost?

Answer:","C
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Complete the sentence.
A can of soda fizzing over is a ().

Choices:
A. chemical change
B. physical change

Answer:","B
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.A can of soda fizzing over is a physical change. The soda fizzes because the gas trapped inside of it comes out very quickly.

Question:
Select the one substance that is not a mineral.

Choices:
A. Muscovite is a pure substance. It is not made by living things.
B. A shark's tooth is made by a living thing. It is not a pure substance.
C. Chrysotile is a solid. It is a pure substance.

Answer:","B
Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Muscovite is a mineral.
A shark's tooth is made by a living thing. But minerals are not made by living things.
A shark's tooth is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
So, a shark's tooth is not a mineral.

Question:
How long is a hiking trail?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 5 meters
B. 5 kilometers

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.The better estimate for the length of a hiking trail is 5 kilometers.
5 meters is too short."

Question:
The city of Newport has been one of the world's biggest makers of cough drops for many years. But last month, Newport's cough drop factories were destroyed by floods. What will probably happen to the overall supply of cough drops?

Choices:
A. The supply will probably go up.
B. The supply will probably go down.

Answer:","B
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.Floods destroyed the cough drop factories in Newport. The number of producers of cough drops went down. So, the supply of cough drops will probably go down."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Nina investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Nina has a small vegetable garden, which includes a compost pile of food scraps. She notices that some of the squash plants growing next to the compost pile grow differently than squash plants that are farther away. She wonders what factors affect how her squash plants grow. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
one type of squash seeds
four large clay pots
soil
a compost pile
water

Choices:
A. If squash seeds and tomato seeds are planted with compost, which type of plant grows larger?
B. Do squash plants grow larger if the seeds are planted with compost or without compost?
C. Do squash plants grow larger if the seeds are planted in small pots or in large pots?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Which brick has more thermal energy?

Hint:
Two 2-kilogram bricks are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. the hotter brick
B. the colder brick

Answer:","A
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two bricks are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter brick has more thermal energy."

Choices:
A. Bb
B. a hairy body

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Remy's observable version of the body hair trait is a hairy body. So, Remy's phenotype for the body hair trait is a hairy body."

B. Jayla made a random trip to the grocery store, though her kitchen was already stocked with a hodgepodge of food.

Answer:","A
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The first text uses random in its traditional sense: made or occurring without a definite pattern.
At the grocery store, Jayla hastily grabbed fruits and vegetables at random, filling her shopping cart with a hodgepodge of food.
The second text uses random in its nontraditional sense: odd or out of place.

Choices:
A. a black coat
B. a reddish-brown coat

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.

An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Ace's phenotype for the coat color trait. First, consider the alleles in Ace's genotype for the coat color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Ace's genotype of Ll has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Ace's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Rudy once fell asleep with the window open and woke up with a horrible migraine. Since then, he's always made sure to close his window before going to sleep.

Choices:
A. slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences
B. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
C. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that an open window caused Rudy's migraine. However, that's not necessarily true. For instance, the migraine might have occurred for no particular reason while the window happened to be open. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as false causation."

Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.
A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length.The best estimate for the length of a ladybug is 8 millimeters.

Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The first sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses overly simple or imprecise language (took, went).
The second sentence uses more precise language, so it is more formal overall."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
We need to raise taxes to improve our public schools. If we don't raise taxes, we are condemning our schools to failure.

Choices:
A. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
B. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
C. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist

Answer:","C
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that either we must raise taxes or public schools will fail. However, there are ways schools can be improved without raising taxes, so these are not the only options. For instance, perhaps existing tax money could be spent differently to improve schools. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy."

Question:
Compare the motion of two bats. Which bat was moving at a lower speed?

Choices:
A. a bat that moved 40kilometers in 10hours
B. a bat that moved 225kilometers in 10hours

Answer:","A
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.Look at the distance each bat moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One bat moved 40 kilometers in 10 hours.
The other bat moved 225 kilometers in 10 hours.
Notice that each bat spent the same amount of time moving. The bat that moved 40 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that bat must have moved at a lower speed."

The mom and dad push the strollers at the same speed. Which stroller is pushed with a larger force?

Hint:
A mom, a dad, and two kids are going for a walk. The mom and the dad each push one of the kids in a stroller. The strollers are the same. But the kids are different sizes.

Choices:
A. a stroller with kid that weighs 27 pounds
B. a stroller with kid that weighs 26 pounds

Answer:","A
A force is a push or a pull.
A force can make an object start moving or stop an object that is moving. A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.
Forces can be different sizes.
Think about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object.Look for the stroller that is heavier.
A stroller holding a kid that weighs 27 pounds is heavier than a stroller holding a kid that weighs 26 pounds. So, the stroller holding the kid that weighs 27 pounds needs to be pushed with a larger force to start moving forward at the same speed as the other other stroller."

Question:
Select the elementary substance.

Choices:
A. bromomethane (CH3Br)
B. hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
C. rhenium (Re)

Answer:","C
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for bromomethane contains three symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, and Br for bromine. So, bromomethane is made of three chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, bromomethane is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for rhenium contains one symbol: Re. So, rhenium is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, rhenium is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for hydrogen peroxide contains two symbols: H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. So, hydrogen peroxide is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, hydrogen peroxide is a compound, not an elementary substance."

Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. Fred's brother Paul wondered whether Fred ran fast enough to qualify for the Boston Marathon.
B. Fred's brother Paul wondered whether he ran fast enough to qualify for the Boston Marathon.

Answer:","B
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.

Question:
Which soap bubble has a lower temperature?

Hint:
Two soap bubbles are identical except for their thermal energies.

Choices:
A. the soap bubble with more thermal energy
B. the soap bubble with less thermal energy

Answer:","B
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two soap bubbles are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the soap bubble with less thermal energy has a lower temperature."

Question:
Select the one substance that is not a mineral.

Choices:
A. An antler is not a pure substance. It is a solid.
B. Native copper is formed in nature. It is a pure substance.
C. Gypsum is not made by living things. It is formed in nature.

Answer:","A
Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Native copper is a mineral.
An antler is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
So, an antler is not a mineral.
Gypsum is a mineral."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
breaking a plate
cutting your fingernails

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","C
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Breaking a plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.
Cutting your fingernails is a physical change. Your fingernails are shorter after you cut them. But the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the uncut fingernails.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Based on this information, what is Scratches's phenotype for the fur type trait?

Hint:
In a group of cats, some individuals have straight fur and others have curly fur. In this group, the gene for the fur type trait has two alleles. The allele F is for straight fur, and the allele f is for curly fur.
Scratches, a cat from this group, has curly fur. Scratches has two alleles for curly fur.

Choices:
A. ff
B. curly fur

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Scratches's observable version of the fur type trait is curly fur. So, Scratches's phenotype for the fur type trait is curly fur."

Hint:
Hint: Driving well takes practice.

Choices:
A. acquired
B. inherited

Answer:","A
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits.Humans are not born knowing how to drive a car. Instead, many people learn how to drive when they are older. So, driving is an acquired trait."

B. Doug's ill-researched essay about the Space Race received a poor grade because it presented such a travesty of the actual historical events.

Answer:","B
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Cassie investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Cassie is making a fruit salad. She mixes some apple slices with orange and pineapple slices, and leaves the rest of the apple slices on the counter. A few minutes later, she notices that the apple slices on the counter have turned brown. She wonders what factors affect how quickly sliced fruit turns brown. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
two apples
two bananas
orange juice
a kitchen knife

Choices:
A. Do apple slices dipped in orange juice turn brown more slowly than plain apple slices?
B. Do apple slices turn brown more quickly if they are dipped in sugar or in orange juice?
C. Do slices of pear turn brown more quickly than slices of banana?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
a piece of avocado turning brown
boiling sugar to make caramel

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","C
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.
Boiling sugar to make caramel is a chemical change. The heat causes the sugar to change into a different type of matter. Unlike sugar, the new matter is brown and sticky.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Boiling sugar is caused by heating. But a piece of avocado turning brown is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Complete the statement.
Argon is ().

Hint:
Argon is a gas used to protect important documents, including the United States Constitution, from decay. The chemical formula for argon is Ar.

Choices:
A. an elementary substance
B. a compound

Answer:","A
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether argon is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for argon is Ar. This formula contains one symbol: Ar. So, the formula tells you that argon is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, argon is an elementary substance."

Question:
According to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?

Hint:
Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
Colton is pushing on his friend's wheelchair.

Choices:
A. The wheelchair is pushing on Colton.
B. The wheelchair is pulling on Colton.

Answer:","A
According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force. This means that if one object is applying a force on a second object, the second object must also be applying a force on the first object, but in the opposite direction.
For example, if your hand is pushing down on a table, the table is also pushing up on your hand. Or, if you are pulling forward on a rope, the rope is also pulling back on you.Colton is pushing on the wheelchair. So, Newton's third law tells you that the wheelchair is pushing on Colton."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Right after Marvin moved into the apartment, our washing machine broke. He'd better tell us how he broke it.

Choices:
A. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
B. hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Marvin is responsible for the broken washing machine. However, the fact that the machine stopped working soon after Marvin moved in doesn't necessarily mean that he caused the machine to break. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as false causation."

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Poseidon's phenotype for the iridescent scales trait?

Hint:
This passage describes the iridescent scales trait in bettas:

In a group of bettas, some individuals have mostly iridescent scales and others have mostly plain scales. In this group, the gene for the iridescent scales trait has two alleles. The allele for mostly iridescent scales (I) is dominant over the allele for mostly plain scales (i).
Poseidon is a betta from this group. Poseidon has the homozygous genotype ii for the iridescent scales gene.

Choices:
A. mostly plain scales
B. mostly iridescent scales

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Poseidon's genotype for the iridescent scales gene is ii. Poseidon's genotype of ii has only i alleles. The i allele is for mostly plain scales. So, Poseidon's phenotype for the iridescent scales trait must be mostly plain scales.
To check this answer, consider whether Poseidon's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for mostly iridescent scales (I) is dominant over the allele for mostly plain scales (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.
Poseidon's genotype of ii has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Poseidon's phenotype for the iridescent scales trait must be mostly plain scales."

Answer:","A
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.All three bricks have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 458°F brick is the hottest, it has the most thermal energy."
"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Select the solid.

Choices:
A. grape juice
B. water from a faucet
C. air from a hair dryer
D. screwdriver

Answer:","D
Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.The air from a hair dryer is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. A hair dryer uses a fan to blow warm air out. When the air leaves the hair dryer, the air expands to fill a much large space.
The water from a faucet is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you put water from a faucet into a container, the water will take the shape of that container. But the water will still take up the same amount of space.
A screwdriver is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. This screwdriver has a metal blade and a plastic handle. Both metal and plastic are solids.
Grape juice is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour grape juice into a different container, the grape juice will take the shape of that container. But the grape juice will still take up the same amount of space."

A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle
dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","D
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.
The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.
Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Dry ice sublimating is caused by heating. But sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
What is the mass of a passenger helicopter?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 3 ounces
B. 3 tons
C. 3 pounds

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton.The best estimate for the mass of a passenger helicopter is 3 tons.
3 ounces and 3 pounds are both too light."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Mia investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Mia leaves a glass jar of cold tea outside in full sunlight. When she goes to get it, she notices that the tea is warm. She wonders what factors affect how warm a liquid gets from sitting in the sunlight. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
two identical glass jars
two jar lids
tap water
a measuring cup
two thermometers

Choices:
A. When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a closed jar or eight ounces of water in an open jar get warmer?
B. Will eight ounces of carbonated water or eight ounces of tap water get warmer when placed in a jar in the sun?
C. When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a glass jar or eight ounces of water in a plastic cup get warmer?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Hint:
The model below shows the Moon at one position in its orbit around Earth. The white half of the Moon shows the part that is lit up by the Sun.

Choices:
A. first quarter
B. new

Answer:","B
Although the Moon appears to shine, it does not give off light. Instead, we can see the Moon because it is lit up by the Sun. The part of the Moon that is both lit up by the Sun and facing Earth is called the Moon's phase.
The Moon orbits, or goes around, Earth. As it does, the Moon's phase changes. The model below shows the Moon's phase at eight positions in its orbit. The smaller moons closer to Earth show where sunlight hits the Moon. The larger moons farther from Earth show how the Moon will look during that phase.
To use the model, first pick one of the eight positions. Then, imagine standing on Earth and looking up at the Moon. Use the dotted white lines in the model to guide you. The picture of the Moon shows its phase for that position. If you are in the Southern Hemisphere, the Moon will appear flipped, left to right."

Question:
Based on this information, what is this fly's phenotype for the wing type trait?

Hint:
This passage describes the wing type trait in fruit flies:

In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).
A certain fruit fly from this group has the heterozygous genotype Nn for the wing type gene.

Choices:
A. normal wings
B. vestigial wings

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine the fruit fly's phenotype for the wing type trait. First, consider the alleles in the fly's genotype for the wing type gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N). This means N is a dominant allele, and n is a recessive allele.
The fruit fly's genotype of Nn has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the wing type trait must be normal wings."

Question:
Compare the motion of two runners. Which runner was moving at a higher speed?

Choices:
A. a runner who moved 100kilometers in 10hours
B. a runner who moved 140kilometers in 10hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed.Look at the distance each runner moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One runner moved 140 kilometers in 10 hours.
The other runner moved 100 kilometers in 10 hours.
Notice that each runner spent the same amount of time moving. The runner who moved 140 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that runner must have moved at a higher speed."

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that the whale's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the whale and Earth () as the whale swam toward the surface.

Hint:
Read the text about an animal in motion.
A whale was swimming deep in the ocean. After a few minutes, the whale swam to the surface of the water to breathe.

Choices:
A. increased
B. stayed the same
C. decreased

Answer:","A
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the whale and the center of Earth changed.
The surface of the water is higher than the point where the whale was swimming deep in the ocean. As the whale swam toward the surface, the distance between the whale and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the whale and Earth increased as the whale swam toward the surface."

B. The supply probably went down.

Answer:","B
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.

Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.When four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, the number of suppliers went down.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
a penny tarnishing
a dinosaur bone turning into rock over millions of years

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","C
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
A dinosaur bone turning into rock is a chemical change. The matter that made up the bone when it was alive begins to break down. Over a long time, a different type of matter starts forming inside small gaps in the bone. The matter is made of minerals from the earth.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.

The fruit fly has one allele for red eyes (E) and one allele for brown eyes (e). So, the fly's genotype for the eye color gene is Ee."

Question:
Which sentence is more formal?

Choices:
A. Ms. Meyer has several important proposals to discuss at the next city council meeting.
B. There are some things that Ms. Meyer wants to bring up at the next city council meeting.

Answer:","A
Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples
slang | cool, awesome
idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store
contractions | can't, won't
Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The first sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses overly simple or imprecise language (some things, bring up).
The second sentence uses more precise language, so it is more formal overall."

Hyperbole is an obvious exaggeration that is not meant to be taken literally.

An oxymoron is a joining of two seemingly contradictory terms.

A paradox is a statement that might at first appear to be contradictory, but that may in fact contain some truth.

Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. Carly looks almost identical to her twin sister Jenny, but she has pierced ears.
B. Carly has pierced ears, but otherwise she looks almost identical to her twin sister Jenny.

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.

Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners.The first memo to customers is more formal.

Question:
According to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?

Hint:
Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
Darnel is pushing on his friend's wheelchair.

Choices:
A. The wheelchair is pushing on Darnel.
B. The wheelchair is pulling on Darnel.

Answer:","A
According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force. This means that if one object is applying a force on a second object, the second object must also be applying a force on the first object, but in the opposite direction.
For example, if your hand is pushing down on a table, the table is also pushing up on your hand. Or, if you are pulling forward on a rope, the rope is also pulling back on you.Darnel is pushing on the wheelchair. So, Newton's third law tells you that the wheelchair is pushing on Darnel."

a tree to hang the feeders from

Choices:

B. Which type of tree do the squirrels feed from most often?
C. Do the squirrels select sunflower seeds or walnuts more often?

Answer:","C
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.

Statements of fact make claims that are based on research, observation, or experimentation. Facts can be proved with evidence.
Napoleon Bonaparte was shorter than King Louis XVI.
This statement is a fact. The statement can be verified by researching and comparing the height of each man.
Statements of opinion make claims that are based on personal judgments or perspectives. Opinions can be supported by evidence, but they cannot be definitively proved.
Napoleon Bonaparte was a better leader than King Louis XVI.
This statement is an opinion. People can have different ideas about what makes someone a ""better"" leader, so the statement cannot be proved.The first sentence states a fact. It can be verified by comparing the number of visitors to U.S. national parks in 2014.

Question:
Based on this information, what is Nabi's phenotype for the agouti fur trait?

Hint:
This passage describes the agouti fur trait in cats:

In a group of cats, some individuals have agouti fur and others do not. In this group, the gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles. The allele for having agouti fur (A) is dominant over the allele for not having agouti fur (a).
Nabi is a cat from this group. Nabi has the homozygous genotype AA for the agouti fur gene.

Choices:
A. not having agouti fur
B. having agouti fur

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Nabi's genotype for the agouti fur gene is AA. Nabi's genotype of AA has only A allelles. The A allele is for having agouti fur. So, Nabi's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be having agouti fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Nabi's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having agouti fur (A) is dominant over the allele for not having agouti fur (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Nabi's genotype of AA has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Nabi's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be having agouti fur."

Question:
What is the volume of a kiddie pool?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 1,080 liters
B. 1,080 milliliters

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters.The better estimate for the volume of a kiddie pool is 1,080 liters.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Krysta has no school spirit—she never comes to any of our football games.

Choices:
A. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
B. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Krysta doesn't have school spirit, because she doesn't go to football games. However, there may be a number of reasons why Krysta doesn't go to football games. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy."

Question:
Which sentence is more formal?

Choices:
A. Novak Electronics has a reputation for responding real quick to customer concerns and questions.
B. Novak Electronics has a reputation for responding quickly to all customer concerns and questions.

Answer:","B
Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples
slang | cool, awesome
idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store
contractions | can't, won't
Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The first sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses conversational language (real quick).
The second sentence uses formal language in place of the conversational language, so it is more formal overall."

Question:
Complete the statement.
Potassium hydroxide is ().

Hint:
Potassium hydroxide is used to make liquid soap. The chemical formula for potassium hydroxide is KOH.

Choices:
A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Answer:","A
There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether potassium hydroxide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for potassium hydroxide, KOH, contains three atomic symbols: K for potassium, O for oxygen, and H for hydrogen. So, the formula tells you that potassium hydroxide is composed of three chemical elements bonded together.
Since potassium hydroxide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, potassium hydroxide is a compound."

B. Do sunflowers grow bigger in sunny planter boxes or in shady planter boxes?
C. Do sunflowers grow taller if they are planted in planter boxes or in pots?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Would you find the word identify on a dictionary page with the following guide words?
image - indicate

Choices:
A. yes
B. no

Answer:","B
Guide words appear on each page of a dictionary. They tell you the first word and last word on the page. The other words on the page come between the guide words in alphabetical order.
To put words in alphabetical order, put them in order by their first letters. If the first letters are the same, look at the second letters. If the second letters are the same, look at the third letters, and so on.
If one word is shorter, and there are no more letters to compare, then the shorter word comes first in alphabetical order. For example, be comes before bed.Put the words in alphabetical order.
Since identify is not between the guide words image - indicate, it would not be found on that page."

Question:
Read the following excerpt from a student essay. How can the writer best improve his or her academic voice?
Many people don't recycle because throwing things away is easier, even though doing so can be damaging to the environment. People are lazy and selfish, always wanting what is good for themselves, not necessarily what is good for society. As a result, many people do not take the steps that are required to recycle different materials. For example, some towns require residents to sort items before leaving them at the curbside; this causes some to skip recycling altogether, even though doing so is unethical.

C. by maintaining an objective tone

Answer:","C
During peer review, you read and respond to a fellow student's writing. While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:
Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?
Voice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?
Sentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?The writer could best improve his or her academic voice by maintaining an objective tone.
For example, the writer could revise the underlined text.

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that the hockey puck's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the hockey puck and Earth () as the puck slid toward the goal.

Hint:
Read the text about an object in motion.
Quincy and Roger were playing air hockey on a level table. When Quincy hit the hockey puck, it slid quickly toward Roger's goal.

Choices:
A. increased
B. stayed the same
C. decreased

Answer:","B
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the hockey puck and the center of Earth changed.
Because the table was level, each point on the table was the same distance from the center of Earth. As the hockey puck slid toward the goal, the distance between the puck and the center of Earth stayed the same. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the hockey puck and Earth stayed the same as the puck slid toward the goal."

Question:
Complete the statement.
Sodium chloride is ().

Hint:
Sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt, is used to prevent roads from getting icy. The chemical formula for sodium chloride is NaCl.

Choices:
A. an elementary substance
B. a compound

Answer:","B
There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether sodium chloride is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for sodium chloride, NaCl, contains two atomic symbols: Na for sodium and Cl for chlorine. So, the formula tells you that sodium chloride is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since sodium chloride is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, sodium chloride is a compound."

Question:
Compare the motion of three geese. Which goose was moving at the highest speed?

Choices:
A. a goose that moved 905kilometers south in 10hours
B. a goose that moved 925kilometers west in 10hours
C. a goose that moved 920kilometers west in 10hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed.Look at the distance each goose moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each goose moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each goose moved for 10 hours. The goose that moved 925 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that goose must have moved at the highest speed."

Choices:
A. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
B. ad hominem: a personal attack against one's opponent

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas
burning a marshmallow over a campfire

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","C
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.
Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.
Burning a marshmallow is a chemical change. The heat from the fire causes the type of matter in the marshmallow to change. The marshmallow becomes black and crispy.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Dry ice sublimating is a physical change. But burning a marshmallow is not.
Both are chemical changes.
Burning a marshmallow is a chemical change. But dry ice sublimating is not.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

B. Minnows live underwater and have fins to help them swim. They have scaly skin and lay eggs with no shells. Many fishermen use minnows as bait to catch other fish.

Answer:","B
Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.
How do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.

Poetry is a special kind of writing. It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.
A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel
In vest of shining white,
In coat of silver gray,
And vest of shining white.
—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, ""The Flying Squirrel""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring""This poem uses repetition. It repeats words, phrases, or lines.
I see them in Asia and in Africa."

The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.

Question:
Which text uses the word factoid in its traditional sense?

Choices:
A. The Livingston Daily Mail was forced to issue a retraction after printing a factoid about Livingston's founder. It turned out that the reporter had written the article based on local legend rather than researching the actual history.
B. A reporter for the Livingston Daily Mail dug up an amusing factoid about Livingston's founder while researching for an article about the town's early years.

Answer:","A
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The first text uses factoid in its traditional sense: something made up presented as a true fact.

Question:
What is the volume of a small beach bucket?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 5 cups
B. 5 fluid ounces
C. 5 gallons

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon.The best estimate for the volume of a small beach bucket is 5 cups.
5 fluid ounces is too little and 5 gallons is too much."

Is the following trait inherited or acquired?
Liam has a scar on his right elbow.

Hint:
Hint: Most scars are caused by accidents during a person's life.

Choices:
A. acquired
B. inherited

Answer:","A
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits.Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
breaking a ceramic plate
water vapor condensing on a bathroom mirror

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","C
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.
Water vapor condensing on a bathroom mirror is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The water changes state from gas in the air to liquid water on the mirror. But the water vapor and the liquid water are both made of water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Water vapor condensing is caused by cooling. But breaking a ceramic plate is not."

Question:
According to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?

Hint:
Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
Nicole's foot is pushing on her car's gas pedal.

Choices:
A. The gas pedal is pulling on Nicole's foot.
B. The gas pedal is pushing on Nicole's foot.

Answer:","B
According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force. This means that if one object is applying a force on a second object, the second object must also be applying a force on the first object, but in the opposite direction.
For example, if your hand is pushing down on a table, the table is also pushing up on your hand. Or, if you are pulling forward on a rope, the rope is also pulling back on you.Nicole's foot is pushing on the gas pedal. So, Newton's third law tells you that the gas pedal is pushing on Nicole's foot."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Skippy's phenotype for the body hair trait?

Hint:
In a group of deer mice, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b).
Skippy is a deer mouse from this group. Skippy has the homozygous genotype bb for the body hair gene.

Choices:
A. a hairy body
B. a hairless body

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Skippy's genotype for the body hair gene is bb. Skippy's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for a hairless body. So, Skippy's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairless body.
To check this answer, consider whether Skippy's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Skippy's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Skippy's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairless body."

Choices:

When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun he could refer to Brian or his brother.
Brian had to stay home with his brother because he wasn't feeling well.
The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
Brian's brother wasn't feeling well, so Brian had to stay home with him."

Question:
Assume all other forces on Max are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on Max?

Hint:
Max is standing on a diving board at the pool. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Max with a force of 400N. The diving board is pushing up on Max with a force of 400N.

Choices:
A. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Max.
B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Max.

Answer:","B
A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.To determine if there is a net force on Max, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Max down with a force of 400 N.
The diving board is pushing Max up with a force of 400 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 400 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Max."

Question:
What is the mass of a passenger helicopter?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 2 tons
B. 2 ounces
C. 2 pounds

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton.The best estimate for the mass of a passenger helicopter is 2 tons.

Question:
Which basketball has more thermal energy?

Hint:
Two basketballs are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. the hotter basketball
B. the colder basketball

Answer:","A
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two basketballs are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter basketball has more thermal energy."

Using only these supplies, which question can Whitney investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Whitney has a small vegetable garden, which includes a compost pile of food scraps. She notices that some of the squash plants growing next to the compost pile grow differently than squash plants that are farther away. She wonders what factors affect how her squash plants grow. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
one type of squash seeds
four large clay pots
soil
a compost pile
water

Choices:
A. Do squash plants grow larger if the seeds are planted in small pots or in large pots?
B. If squash seeds and tomato seeds are planted with compost, which type of plant grows larger?
C. Do squash plants grow larger if the seeds are planted with compost or without compost?

Answer:","C
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Ms. Thompson has suggested that our schools let students take statistics instead of algebra to graduate. Frankly, it is puzzling to me that she thinks algebra is a useless subject.

Choices:
A. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
B. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
C. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

Answer:","C
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Ms. Thompson thinks algebra is useless because she would let students take statistics instead. However, Ms. Thompson only claimed that students should be allowed to take statistics instead of algebra. She did not suggest that algebra is a useless subject. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait?

Hint:
In a group of rabbits, some individuals have black fur and others have brown fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F).
Ringo is a rabbit from this group. Ringo has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur color gene.

Choices:
A. black fur
B. brown fur

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Ringo's genotype for the fur color gene is ff. Ringo's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for brown fur. So, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be brown fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Ringo's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Ringo's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be brown fur."

Choices:
A. There are some things that Ms. Dotson wants to bring up at the next city council meeting.
B. Ms. Dotson has several important proposals to discuss at the next city council meeting.

Answer:","B
Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples
slang | cool, awesome
idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store
contractions | can't, won't
Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The first sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses overly simple or imprecise language (some things, bring up).
The second sentence uses more precise language, so it is more formal overall."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Mr. Wells argues that we need to do more to prevent workplace injuries and fatalities. I doubt that someone so socially awkward would know a thing about office safety.

Choices:
A. ad hominem: a personal attack against one's opponent
B. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that being socially awkward determines knowledge of workplace safety. This is a personal attack that isn't relevant to Mr. Wells's desire to prevent workplace injuries. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as ad hominem."

Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters.The better estimate for the volume of a bowl of soup is 285 milliliters.
285 liters is too much."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Finn investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Finn has a pet lizard. Finn notices that on some days, the lizard is active and runs around the tank. On other days, the lizard hardly moves at all. Finn wonders what factors affect how active his lizard is. So, he decides to design an experiment. He has the following supplies available:
one pet lizard
live crickets
live mealworms
one heating lamp

Choices:
A. Is the pet lizard more active when its tank is heated with one heating lamp or with two heating lamps?
B. Is the pet lizard more active when it is fed insects or lettuce?
C. Is the pet lizard more active when it is fed crickets or mealworms?

Answer:","C
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Based on this information, what is Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait?

Hint:
In a group of rock pocket mice, some individuals have dark fur and others have light fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for dark fur (F) is dominant over the allele for light fur (f).
Ringo is a rock pocket mouse from this group. Ringo has the heterozygous genotype Ff for the fur color gene.

Choices:
A. light fur
B. dark fur

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait. First, consider the alleles in Ringo's genotype for the fur color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for dark fur (F) is dominant over the allele for light fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Ringo's genotype of Ff has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be dark fur."

Question:
Complete the statement.
Platinum is ().

Hint:
Platinum is a precious metal used to make jewelry. The chemical formula for platinum is Pt.

Choices:
A. an elementary substance
B. a compound

Answer:","A
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether platinum is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for platinum is Pt. This formula contains one symbol: Pt. So, the formula tells you that platinum is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, platinum is an elementary substance."

Sodium bromide is ().

Hint:
Sodium bromide can be used to kill bacteria in swimming pools. The chemical formula for sodium bromide is NaBr.

Choices:
A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Answer:","A
There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether sodium bromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for sodium bromide, NaBr, contains two atomic symbols: Na for sodium and Br for bromine. So, the formula tells you that sodium bromide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since sodium bromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, sodium bromide is a compound."

Answer:","B
Conifers are plants that grow cones. Conifers use their cones to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do conifers use their cones to reproduce?
Conifers can grow male and female cones. Male cones make pollen, and female cones make eggs. Pollination is what happens when wind blows pollen from male cones onto female cones. After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds.
The seeds can fall out of the cones and land on the ground. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant.Conifers use their cones to make seeds. Seeds grow inside the female cones.

B. Rosanne and her mother both have short hair.

Answer:","A
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Precious's genotype for the fur type gene?

Hint:
In a group of cats, some individuals have straight fur and others have curly fur. In this group, the gene for the fur type trait has two alleles. The allele F is for straight fur, and the allele f is for curly fur.
Precious, a cat from this group, has straight fur. Precious has two alleles for straight fur.

Choices:
A. FF
B. straight fur

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Precious has two alleles for straight fur (F). So, Precious's genotype for the fur type gene is FF."

Question:
Compare the motion of two buses. Which bus was moving at a higher speed?

Choices:
A. a bus that moved 825kilometers in 10hours
B. a bus that moved 460kilometers in 10hours

Answer:","A
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed.Look at the distance each bus moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One bus moved 825 kilometers in 10 hours.
The other bus moved 460 kilometers in 10 hours.
Notice that each bus spent the same amount of time moving. The bus that moved 825 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that bus must have moved at a higher speed."

Answer:","A
Vertebrates and invertebrates are both groups of animals.
A vertebrate has a backbone. The backbone is made of many bones in an animal's back. A vertebrate's backbone helps connect the different parts of its body. In the drawings below, each vertebrate's backbone is colored orange.
An invertebrate does not have a backbone. In fact, invertebrates do not have any bones! Some invertebrates have an outer cover on their body called an exoskeleton. Other invertebrates have a soft body.A bess beetle is an insect. Like other insects, a bess beetle is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton.
A Caribbean spiny lobster is a crustacean. Like other crustaceans, a Caribbean spiny lobster is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton.

What can seeds look like?

Choices:
A. Seeds come in many colors. But all seeds are small.
B. Seeds can come in many colors and sizes.
C. Seeds come in many sizes. But all seeds are black.

Answer:","B
Many plants have flowers. These plants can use their flowers to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do plants use their flowers to reproduce?
First, the male part of the flower makes pollen, and the female part makes eggs. Animals, wind, or water can move pollen. Pollination is what happens when pollen is moved to the female part of the flower.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with the eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds. The fruit grows around the seeds. Later, a seed can fall out of the fruit. It can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant.Seeds can be big or small. This coconut seed is big.
Seeds can be many different shapes. These maple seeds are long and flat.
Seeds can be many different colors. These mustard seeds are yellow."

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Tim, the company you work for just filed for bankruptcy! How can I trust you with our money?

Choices:
A. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
B. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Tim must be fiscally irresponsible, because he works for a company that went bankrupt. However, even though his company is perceived as fiscally irresponsible, that doesn't necessarily mean that Tim is, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."

Propane is ().

Hint:
Propane is used as fuel for heaters, engines, and outdoor grills. The chemical formula for propane is C3H8.

Choices:
A. an elementary substance
B. a compound

Answer:","B
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether propane is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for propane is C3 H8. This formula contains two symbols: C for carbon and H for hydrogen. So, the formula tells you that propane is made of two chemical elements bonded together.
Substances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, propane is a compound."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Pepe's phenotype for the ear type trait?

Hint:
This passage describes the ear type trait in rats:

In a group of rats, some individuals have normal ears and others have dumbo ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for dumbo ears (e) is recessive to the allele for normal ears (E).
Pepe is a rat from this group. Pepe has the homozygous genotype EE for the ear type gene.

Choices:
A. dumbo ears
B. normal ears

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Pepe's genotype for the ear type gene is EE. Pepe's genotype of EE has only E allelles. The E allele is for normal ears. So, Pepe's phenotype for the ear type trait must be normal ears.
To check this answer, consider whether Pepe's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for dumbo ears (e) is recessive to the allele for normal ears (E). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
Pepe's genotype of EE has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Pepe's phenotype for the ear type trait must be normal ears."

Question:
Based on this information, what is this fruit fly's genotype for the wing type gene?

Hint:
This passage describes the wing type trait in fruit flies:

In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele N is for normal wings, and the allele n is for vestigial wings.
A certain fruit fly from this group has vestigial wings. This fly has two alleles for vestigial wings.

Choices:
A. vestigial wings
B. nn

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The fruit fly has two alleles for vestigial wings (n). So, the fly's genotype for the wing type gene is nn."

Answer:","B
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

a white cotton shirt
two identical empty glass jars
two thermometers

Choices:
A. When wrapped in a cotton shirt and placed in the sun, does a large jar or a small jar heat up more?

C. When placed in the sun, does a glass jar wrapped in a black cotton shirt heat up more than a glass jar wrapped in a white cotton shirt?

Answer:","C
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Answer:","B
Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.
How do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.

Answer:","A
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.All three gold bars have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 31°F gold bar is the hottest, it has the most thermal energy."

Question:
Which kind of place usually has less traffic?

Choices:
A. a rural area
B. an urban area

Answer:","A
People around the world live in three main kinds of places: urban areas, suburban areas, and rural areas.
An urban area is a city. It has many people and businesses. The buildings are close to each other. The buildings are often tall and have many floors. Since there are so many people, traffic is usually bad. People will walk or take the bus, train, or subway to avoid traffic.
A suburban area, or suburb, is near a city. It is quieter and less crowded than an urban area. People usually live in houses with yards. Most people drive to get places.
A rural area is less crowded than both urban and suburban areas. Houses are much more spread out. People usually have to drive to get places. People in rural areas often live on farms or ranches.
Some places, like small towns, don't really fit into any of the types. A small town does not have as many people as an urban area, but it has more people than a rural area. It is not near a city, so it is not called a suburb.Rural areas have much less traffic. There aren't as many people or cars in rural areas."

To put words in alphabetical order, put them in order by their first letters. If the first letters are the same, look at the second letters. If the second letters are the same, look at the third letters, and so on.
If one word is shorter, and there are no more letters to compare, then the shorter word comes first in alphabetical order. For example, be comes before bed.Put the words in alphabetical order.
Since middle is between the guide words meadow - mole, it would be found on that page."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Jill investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Jill visits a museum about ancient Greece. She notices an exhibit with models of wooden catapults that were used to launch large rocks across battlefields. She wonders what factors affect how far a catapult can launch an object. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
a wooden catapult with a 10-inch-long arm
a wooden catapult with a five-inch-long arm
two identical rubber balls

Choices:
A. Does a catapult with a longer arm launch a rubber ball farther than a catapult with a shorter arm?
B. Does a rubber ball travel farther when launched from a metal catapult or from a wooden catapult?
C. Does a heavier ball travel farther than a lighter ball when launched from a catapult?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Which mug of cocoa has a higher temperature?

Hint:
Two 200-gram mugs of cocoa are identical except for their thermal energies.

Choices:
A. the mug of cocoa with less thermal energy
B. the mug of cocoa with more thermal energy

Answer:","B
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two mugs of cocoa are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the mug of cocoa with more thermal energy has a higher temperature."

Choices:
A. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
B. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Gina must watch reality television, because her sister watches reality television. However, even though Gina's sister watches reality television, that doesn't necessarily mean that Gina does, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Chitters's genotype for the leg color gene?

Hint:
In a group of chickens, some individuals have white legs and others have yellow legs. In this group, the gene for the leg color trait has two alleles. The allele L is for white legs, and the allele l is for yellow legs.
Chitters, a chicken from this group, has white legs. Chitters has two alleles for white legs.

Choices:
A. LL
B. white legs

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Chitters has two alleles for white legs (L). So, Chitters's genotype for the leg color gene is LL."

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Skip's phenotype for the horns trait. First, consider the alleles in Skip's genotype for the horns gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Skip's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Skip's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns."

Question:
What information supports the conclusion that Tara acquired this trait?

Hint:
Read the description of a trait.
Tara knows how to grow sunflowers.

Choices:
A. Tara likes to visit sunflower fields.
B. Both Tara and her father grow sunflowers.
C. Last summer, Tara's neighbor showed her how to grow sunflowers.

Answer:","C
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Question:
Does the sentence use a simile or a metaphor?
From across the room, Uncle Josh's laughter was booming thunder.

Choices:
A. metaphor
B. simile

Answer:","A
Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.

The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.

How long is a hammer?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 25 centimeters
B. 25 meters

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.

Using only these supplies, which question can Ayana investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Ayana leaves some chocolates in her jacket pocket. When she finds the chocolates later, she notices that some of them have melted. She wonders what factors affect how quickly chocolate melts. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
one bar of milk chocolate
one bar of dark chocolate
a stove
a pot

Choices:
A. Does milk chocolate melt faster when heated in a microwave or on a stove?
B. Does milk chocolate or dark chocolate melt faster when heated on the stove?
C. Does dark chocolate or white chocolate melt faster when heated on the stove?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Which object has more thermal energy?

Hint:
The objects are identical except for their temperatures.

A. a cherry pie at a temperature of 100°F
B. a cherry pie at a temperature of 85°F

Answer:","A
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.The two cherry pies have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 100°F pie is hotter than the 85°F pie, it has more thermal energy."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
bleaching clothes
a piece of apple turning brown

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","C
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Bleaching clothes is a chemical change. The bleach reacts with dark stains on the clothes. The reaction changes the stains into different types of matter that wash away easily.
A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
How long is a spider's leg?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 20 meters
B. 20 kilometers
C. 20 millimeters

Answer:","C
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.
A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length.The best estimate for the length of a spider's leg is 20 millimeters.
20 meters and 20 kilometers are both too long."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Vivian investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Vivian is outside with her friend on a sunny day. Vivian is wearing a light-colored shirt, and she notices that she feels colder than her friend, who is wearing a dark shirt. She wonders what factors affect how fabric warms an object. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
a black cotton shirt
a white cotton shirt
two identical empty glass jars
two thermometers

Choices:
A. When placed in the sun, does a glass jar wrapped in cotton heat up more than a glass jar wrapped in wool?
B. When wrapped in a cotton shirt and placed in the sun, does a large jar or a small jar heat up more?
C. When placed in the sun, does a glass jar wrapped in a black cotton shirt heat up more than a glass jar wrapped in a white cotton shirt?

Answer:","C
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Is the following trait inherited or acquired?
Tim has five toes on each foot.

Choices:
A. inherited
B. acquired

Answer:","A
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits.Most humans are born with five toes on each foot. So, having five toes is an inherited trait."

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Troy, the company you work for just filed for bankruptcy! How can I trust you with our money?

Choices:
A. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
B. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Troy must be fiscally irresponsible, because he works for a company that went bankrupt. However, even though his company is perceived as fiscally irresponsible, that doesn't necessarily mean that Troy is, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."

"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Select the liquid.

Choices:
A. umbrella
B. rain
C. plate
D. helium

Answer:","B
Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.Rain is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you put rainwater into a bucket, the rainwater will take the shape of the bucket. But the rainwater will still take up the same amount of space.
A plate is a solid. If someone drops a plate, it may break into pieces. But each piece will still have a size and shape of its own.
An umbrella is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When you open an umbrella, it still has a size and shape of its own.
Helium is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. Helium is lighter than air. So, if you fill a balloon with helium, the balloon will rise. If helium leaks out of the balloon, the helium will expand into the space around the balloon."

Choices:
A. The supply probably went down.
B. The supply probably went up.

Answer:","A
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.When four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, the number of suppliers went down. There were fewer stores selling men's shirts. So, the supply of men's shirts probably went down."

Answer:","A
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The first text uses terribly in its traditional sense: in a terrible manner.
Ronald shivered terribly as he gazed at the snow-clad slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
The second text uses terribly in its nontraditional sense: extremely; very.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
An antacid tablet reacting with water is a chemical change. When the tablet touches water, the type of matter in the tablet changes and carbon dioxide gas is released. This gas makes the water fizz.
Burning food on a stove is a chemical change. When the food burns, the type of matter in it changes. The food turns black and gives off smoke.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Burning is caused by heating. But an antacid tablet reacting with water is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. Robert was recently reading about remote mountain villages, and it said that they often have no Internet access. He couldn't imagine life without email!
B. Robert was recently reading about remote mountain villages, and the article said that they often have no Internet access. He couldn't imagine life without email!

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

Question:
Based on this information, what is Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait?

Hint:
This passage describes the coat graying trait in horses:

In a group of horses, some individuals have coat graying and others do not. In this group, the gene for the coat graying trait has two alleles. The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g).
Dolly is a horse from this group. Dolly has the homozygous genotype gg for the coat graying gene.

Choices:
A. not having a graying coat
B. having a graying coat

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Dolly's genotype for the coat graying gene is gg. Dolly's genotype of gg has only g alleles. The g allele is for not having a graying coat. So, Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait must be not having a graying coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Dolly's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.
Dolly's genotype of gg has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait must be not having a graying coat."

Aaron can ride a motorcycle.

Hint:
Hint: Riding a motorcycle well takes practice.

Choices:
A. acquired
B. inherited

Answer:","A
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits.People are not born knowing how to ride a motorcycle. Instead, many people learn how to ride. So, riding a motorcycle is an acquired trait."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle
an iceberg melting slowly

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","B
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.
The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
An iceberg melting is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. An iceberg is made of frozen water. As it melts, the water changes from a solid to a liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
An iceberg melting is caused by heating. But sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Which text uses the word nauseous in its traditional sense?

Choices:
A. Lara's little brother looked a little sick after eating mounds of candy and then going on the nauseous rides at the state fair.
B. Lara's little brother looked a little nauseous after eating mounds of candy and then going on the dizzying rides at the state fair.

Answer:","A
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The first text uses nauseous in its traditional sense: causing disgust or nausea.
Lara's little brother looked a little sick after eating mounds of candy and then going on the nauseous rides at the state fair.
The second text uses nauseous in its nontraditional sense: feeling disgusted or nauseated.
Lara's little brother looked a little nauseous after eating mounds of candy and then going on the dizzying rides at the state fair.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Senator Swift announced today that she plans to cut funding to early childhood education programs. The last thing we need is a government official who hates children!

Choices:
A. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
B. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Senator Swift hates children, because she wants to cut education funding. However, the fact that Senator Swift wants to cut education funding doesn't necessarily suggest that she hates children. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man."

B. Loggerhead sea turtles hatch from eggs with shells. They live in the water, but they lay their eggs on the land. Their scaly, waterproof skin and thick shell help protect them from predators.

Answer:","A
Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.
How do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.
Amphibians have the following traits:
They spend part of their lives in water and part on land.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
rust forming on a bike frame
a penny tarnishing

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","A
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Rust forming on a bike frame is a chemical change. The metal on the bike changes into rust. Metal and rust are different types of matter.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Based on this information, what is this fish's phenotype for the body color trait?

Hint:
In a group of Nile tilapia fish, some individuals have a greenish-brown body and others have a pink body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a pink body (b) is recessive to the allele for a greenish-brown body (B).
A certain Nile tilapia fish from this group has the homozygous genotype bb for the body color gene.

Choices:
A. a greenish-brown body
B. a pink body

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The Nile tilapia fish's genotype for the body color gene is bb. The Nile tilapia fish's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for a pink body. So, the Nile tilapia fish's phenotype for the body color trait must be a pink body.
To check this answer, consider whether the Nile tilapia fish's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a pink body (b) is recessive to the allele for a greenish-brown body (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
The Nile tilapia fish's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the Nile tilapia fish's phenotype for the body color trait must be a pink body."

Question:
Select the elementary substance.

Choices:
A. methane (CH4)
B. water (H2O)
C. zinc (Zn)

Answer:","C
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for water contains two symbols: H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. So, water is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, water is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for zinc contains one symbol: Zn. So, zinc is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, zinc is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for methane contains two symbols: C for carbon and H for hydrogen. So, methane is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, methane is a compound, not an elementary substance."

B. a goose that moved 235miles in 5hours

Answer:","A
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.Look at the distance each goose moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One goose moved 190 miles in 5 hours.
The other goose moved 235 miles in 5 hours.

Question:
What is the mass of a full bag of groceries?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 8 tons
B. 8 pounds
C. 8 ounces

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton.The best estimate for the mass of a full bag of groceries is 8 pounds.
8 ounces is too light and 8 tons is too heavy."

Question:
Select the one animal that has all of the reptile traits listed above.

Hint:
Reptiles are a group of animals with similar traits. The following traits can be used to identify reptiles:
They have scaly, waterproof skin.
They make eggs with shells. Observe the animals and read the descriptions.

Choices:
A. Common snapping turtles hatch from eggs with shells. They have powerful beaks. When a snapping turtle is threatened by a predator, it snaps its beak! Snapping turtles have scaly, waterproof skin.
B. Salmon lay eggs with no shells at the bottom of freshwater streams. Salmon use their powerful fins to swim. They can even jump up small waterfalls!

Answer:","A
Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.
How do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.
Reptiles have the following traits:
They have scaly, waterproof skin.
They make eggs with shells.
Compare each animal's traits to the group's traits. Select the animal with traits similar to the group's traits.

Choices:
A. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
B. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
C. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

Answer:","C
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

A dinosaur bone turning into rock over millions of years is a ().

Choices:
A. chemical change
B. physical change

Answer:","A
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.A dinosaur bone turning into rock is a chemical change. The matter that made up the bone when it was alive begins to break down. Over a long time, a different type of matter starts forming inside small gaps in the bone.

B. During Homecoming Weekend, former students are invited to attend a banquet and other events at the college.

Answer:","B
Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples
slang | cool, awesome
idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store
contractions | can't, won't
Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses overly simple or imprecise language (everyone, come to).

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that Joseph's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between Joseph and Earth () as he hiked toward the summit.

Hint:
Read the text about a person in motion.
Joseph hiked up a tall mountain. He followed a trail all the way to the summit.

Choices:
A. increased
B. stayed the same
C. decreased

Answer:","A
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between Joseph and the center of Earth changed.
The summit of the mountain was higher than the point where Joseph started hiking. As he hiked toward the summit, the distance between Joseph and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between Joseph and Earth increased as he hiked toward the summit."

Choices:
A. Does white sandwich bread grow visible mold in fewer days if the bread is stored inside or outside the refrigerator?
B. Does white sandwich bread grow visible mold in fewer days if the bread is stored in a paper bag or in a plastic bag?
C. Does white or whole wheat sandwich bread grow visible mold in fewer days?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
What is the mass of a floor lamp?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 10 tons
B. 10 pounds
C. 10 ounces

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton.The best estimate for the mass of a floor lamp is 10 pounds.
10 ounces is too light and 10 tons is too heavy."

Question:
Is the following trait inherited or acquired?
Darnel has naturally black hair.

Hint:
Hint: Some people dye their hair. But this does not change their natural hair color.

Choices:
A. inherited
B. acquired

Answer:","A
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits.Humans do not choose their natural hair color. Instead, children get their natural hair color from their parents. So, Darnel's hair color is an inherited trait."

Which text uses the word literally in its traditional sense?

Choices:
A. Jayce's new kitten—barely three weeks old—was literally the size of a softball; it could just about fit in the palm of his hand.
B. Jayce's new kitten—barely three weeks old—was literally just a ball of fluff in the palm of his hand.

Answer:","A
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The second text uses literally in its traditional sense: in a factual, non-exaggerated way.
Jayce's new kitten—barely three weeks old—was literally the size of a softball; it could just about fit in the palm of his hand.
The first text uses literally in its nontraditional sense: nearly or in effect (often exaggerated). Jayce's new kitten is not actually just a ball of fluff.
Jayce's new kitten—barely three weeks old—was literally just a ball of fluff in the palm of his hand.

All living things are made up of cells. Plants, animals, and some fungi have many cells. Other living things are made up of just one cell.
All living things need food and water. Water helps living things break down food and remove waste. Food gives living things energy. They use energy from food to grow and change.
All living things sense changes in their environment. Living things might sense changes by seeing, smelling, hearing, or feeling. Living things can respond to the changes they sense.An airplane is not a living thing.
An airplane does not have all the traits of a living thing. It needs energy to fly, but it does not eat food. Airplanes get energy from gasoline or other fuel. They do not grow.
A raspberry bush is a living thing.
Raspberry bushes grow and respond to their environment. They need food and water. Raspberry bushes are made up of many cells.
Raspberry bushes are plants. They make their own food using water, carbon dioxide, and energy from sunlight.

Answer:","A
Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.

Answer:","C
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.

The First Amendment says that the government cannot take away a person's freedom of speech or freedom of religion. In the United States, voting rights are not a part of freedom of speech. Freedom of speech means that Americans can say and write what they want. But there are some limits on freedom of speech. For example, a person cannot write lies about someone in a newspaper. But the government cannot stop speech just because someone disagrees with it. Freedom of religion means a person can choose his or her own religion. In the United States, the government cannot tell a person what to believe. The complete text of the First Amendment is below. Does it mention any other rights? Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
breaking a ceramic plate
mixing chocolate syrup into milk

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","D
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.
Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change. The chocolate syrup and milk make a mixture. Making a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"
"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
How long does it take to brush your teeth?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 2 seconds
B. 2 minutes

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour.The better estimate for how long it takes to brush your teeth is 2 minutes.

Question:
Which brick has less thermal energy?

Hint:
Two 2-kilogram bricks are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. the hotter brick
B. the colder brick

Answer:","B
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two bricks are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder brick has less thermal energy."

Choices:
A. The Great Depression was felt only in the Western Hemisphere.
B. The Great Depression only affected the United States.
C. The Great Depression's impact was limited to North American countries.
D. The Great Depression affected countries around the world.

Question:
According to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?

Hint:
Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
Samantha's foot is pushing on her car's gas pedal.

Choices:
A. The gas pedal is pushing on Samantha's foot.
B. The gas pedal is pulling on Samantha's foot.

Answer:","A
According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force. This means that if one object is applying a force on a second object, the second object must also be applying a force on the first object, but in the opposite direction.
For example, if your hand is pushing down on a table, the table is also pushing up on your hand. Or, if you are pulling forward on a rope, the rope is also pulling back on you.Samantha's foot is pushing on the gas pedal. So, Newton's third law tells you that the gas pedal is pushing on Samantha's foot."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
water freezing into ice
bending a paper clip

Choices:
A. Both are caused by heating.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","C
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Water freezing into ice is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The water changes from solid to liquid. But the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water.
Bending a paper clip is a physical change. After you bend it, the paper clip has a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Water freezing is caused by cooling. But bending a paper clip is not."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Since Greenville College receives more applications for admission than Springtown University, Greenville College is evidently a better school.

Choices:
A. hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations
B. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
C. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Greenville College is better than Springtown University because Greenville College receives more applications. However, the popularity of a school does not necessarily indicate its quality. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as the bandwagon fallacy."

Answer:","B
Guide words appear on each page of a dictionary. They tell you the first word and last word on the page. The other words on the page come between the guide words in alphabetical order.
To put words in alphabetical order, put them in order by their first letters. If the first letters are the same, look at the second letters. If the second letters are the same, look at the third letters, and so on.
If one word is shorter, and there are no more letters to compare, then the shorter word comes first in alphabetical order. For example, be comes before bed.Put the words in alphabetical order.

Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Mixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.

Question:
Based on this information, what is Basil's phenotype for the eye color trait?

Hint:
In a group of guinea pigs, some individuals have brown eyes and others have red eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for red eyes (e).
Basil is a guinea pig from this group. Basil has the homozygous genotype ee for the eye color gene.

Choices:
A. brown eyes
B. red eyes

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Basil's genotype for the eye color gene is ee. Basil's genotype of ee has only e alleles. The e allele is for red eyes. So, Basil's phenotype for the eye color trait must be red eyes.
To check this answer, consider whether Basil's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for brown eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for red eyes (e). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
Basil's genotype of ee has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Basil's phenotype for the eye color trait must be red eyes."

During peer review, you read and respond to a fellow student's writing. While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:
Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?
Voice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?
Sentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?The writer could best improve his or her grammar and mechanics by using consistent verb tenses.
For example, the writer could use past tense for all verbs but the last one; now indicates that the last sentence should be written in present tense.

Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel
In vest of shining white,
In coat of silver gray,
And vest of shining white.
—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, ""The Flying Squirrel""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring""This poem has a regular rhythm, or a pattern of sound like a beat. The parts in bold show the strong syllables. The pattern is a weak syllable followed by a strong syllable. It sounds like da-DUM da-DUM.
And that is well,"" said Lady Clare."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Bingo's phenotype for the wool color trait?

Hint:
In a group of sheep, some individuals have white wool and others have black wool. In this group, the gene for the wool color trait has two alleles. The allele L is for white wool, and the allele l is for black wool.
Bingo, a sheep from this group, has black wool. Bingo has two alleles for black wool.

Choices:
A. black wool
B. ll

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Bingo's observable version of the wool color trait is black wool. So, Bingo's phenotype for the wool color trait is black wool."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait?

Hint:
In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).
Daffodil is a cow from this group. Daffodil has the homozygous genotype hh for the horns gene.

Choices:
A. not having horns
B. having horns

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.

An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Daffodil's genotype for the horns gene is hh. Daffodil's genotype of hh has only h alleles. The h allele is for having horns. So, Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait must be having horns.
To check this answer, consider whether Daffodil's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Daffodil's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait must be having horns."

Question:
Which job does the circulatory system do?

Choices:
A. It brings nutrients to cells.
B. It breaks down food into small pieces.

Answer:","A
To stay alive, animal cells must get water and oxygen. Animal cells also produce carbon dioxide, a waste that must be removed. An animal's respiratory and circulatory systems work together to do these jobs.
An animal's respiratory system is made up of organs that work together to bring in oxygen gas from the environment. The respiratory system also removes carbon dioxide gas from the animal's body. Some animals have lungs to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with the air. Other animals have gills to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with water.
An animal's circulatory system is made up of organs that work together to move blood through its body. The heart pumps blood through blood vessels throughout the body. As blood moves through blood vessels, it delivers oxygen, nutrients from food, and water to cells. Blood also absorbs waste, including carbon dioxide. When the blood is pumped into the lungs or gills, it releases carbon dioxide and absorbs oxygen.The circulatory system brings oxygen, nutrients, and water to cells. It also helps remove carbon dioxide waste.
The circulatory system does not break down food into small pieces. This job is done by the digestive system. After the digestive system breaks down food, blood vessels in the intestines absorb the nutrients from the food. The blood then carries the nutrients to cells throughout the body."

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
How do I know that Beth is the most intelligent person in our geometry class? I know because she's so smart.

Choices:
A. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
B. hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Beth is intelligent because she's smart. However, the ""evidence"" is just a restatement of the claim itself. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as circular reasoning."

Answer:","B
A chemical change occurs when new substances are formed from existing substances. This process is called a chemical reaction.
In a chemical reaction, one or more substances change into one or more different substances. During the reaction, the atoms of the original substances are rearranged to form other substances.
The original substances in a chemical reaction are called reactants. These substances react, or go through a chemical change.
The substances that are formed in a chemical reaction are called products. These substances are produced by the chemical reaction.
So, in a chemical reaction, reactants go through a chemical change to form products.Read the underlined text carefully. Look for information about what happens to nitrous oxide in this chemical reaction.

What is the source of the allusion in the sentence below?
""Luca's personality is very Jekyll and Hyde,"" Kari told her brother.

Choices:
A. literature
B. U.S. history

Answer:","A
An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately.The source of the allusion Jekyll and Hyde is literature.
Robert Louis Stevenson's popular Victorian novella Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde tells the story of a man with two distinct personalities. Known to the world as a kind and highly respected doctor, at night he transforms into a monstrous person.
The allusion Jekyll and Hyde means kind then cruel."

Question:
What is the volume of a kitchen sink?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 22 liters
B. 22 milliliters

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters.The better estimate for the volume of a kitchen sink is 22 liters.
22 milliliters is too little."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Carly investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Carly leaves a glass jar of cold tea outside in full sunlight. When she goes to get it, she notices that the tea is warm. She wonders what factors affect how warm a liquid gets from sitting in the sunlight. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
two identical glass jars
two jar lids
tap water
a measuring cup
two thermometers

Choices:
A. When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a closed jar or eight ounces of water in an open jar get warmer?
B. Will eight ounces of carbonated water or eight ounces of tap water get warmer when placed in a jar in the sun?
C. When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a glass jar or eight ounces of water in a plastic cup get warmer?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
An increasing number of people are keeping ferrets as pets, so they must make wonderful companion animals.

Choices:
A. hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence
B. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that ferrets make good pets, because many people are getting them. However, even though many people have ferrets, that doesn't necessarily mean that ferrets make good pets. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as the bandwagon fallacy."

Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
baking an apple pie
using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","D
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes when it is baked. The crust turns brown, and the apples become soft.
A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again.
The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Baking is caused by heating. But polish removing tarnish from a silver spoon is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Complete the statement.
Gallium arsenide is ().

Hint:
Gallium arsenide is found in the solar cells that power the robotic vehicles used by scientists to explore Mars. The chemical formula for gallium arsenide is GaAs.

Choices:
A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Answer:","A
There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether gallium arsenide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for gallium arsenide, GaAs, contains two atomic symbols: Ga for gallium and As for arsenic. So, the formula tells you that gallium arsenide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since gallium arsenide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, gallium arsenide is a compound."

Compare the motion of three ducks. Which duck was moving at the highest speed?

Choices:
A. a duck that moved 175miles west in 5hours
B. a duck that moved 220miles east in 5hours
C. a duck that moved 260miles north in 5hours

Answer:","C
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed.Look at the distance each duck moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each duck moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each duck moved for 5 hours. The duck that moved 260 miles moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that duck must have moved at the highest speed."

B. The student council requested that more lockers be installed immediately to accommodate the incoming freshman class.

Answer:","B
Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples
slang | cool, awesome
idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store

Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The first sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses abbreviated language (ASAP).
The second sentence does not use abbreviated language, so it is more formal."

Assume all other forces on Gabe are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on Gabe?

Hint:
Gabe is standing on a diving board at the pool. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Gabe with a force of 400N. The diving board is pushing up on Gabe with a force of 400N.

Choices:
A. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Gabe.
B. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Gabe.

Answer:","A
A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.To determine if there is a net force on Gabe, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Gabe down with a force of 400 N.
The diving board is pushing Gabe up with a force of 400 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 400 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Gabe."

Question:
According to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?

Hint:
Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
Miranda's hand is pushing on a door.

Choices:
A. The door is pulling on Miranda's hand.
B. The door is pushing on Miranda's hand.

Answer:","B
According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force. This means that if one object is applying a force on a second object, the second object must also be applying a force on the first object, but in the opposite direction.
For example, if your hand is pushing down on a table, the table is also pushing up on your hand. Or, if you are pulling forward on a rope, the rope is also pulling back on you.Miranda's hand is pushing on the door. So, Newton's third law tells you that the door is pushing on Miranda's hand."

Select the one substance that is not a mineral.

Choices:
A. Sphalerite is a solid. It is a pure substance.
B. Paper is not a pure substance. It is a solid.
C. Pyrite is not made by living things. It is formed in nature.

Answer:","B
Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Pyrite is a mineral.
Paper is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.

A. Molly didn't enter student politics until her junior year.
B. Molly did not enter student politics until her junior year.

Answer:","B
Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples
slang | cool, awesome
idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store
contractions | can't, won't
Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses a contraction (didn't).
The first sentence does not use a contraction, so it is more formal."

Question:
What information supports the conclusion that Javier inherited this trait?

Hint:
Read the description of a trait.
Javier has hazel eyes.

Choices:
A. Javier's friend also has hazel eyes.
B. Javier's biological father wears contacts in his hazel eyes.
C. Javier wears glasses and so do his sisters.

Answer:","B
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."
"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait?

Hint:
This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants:

In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G).
A certain rose plant from this group has the homozygous genotype gg for the growth pattern gene.

Choices:
A. bush growth
B. climbing growth

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The rose plant's genotype for the growth pattern gene is gg. The rose plant's genotype of gg has only g alleles. The g allele is for bush growth. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait must be bush growth.
To check this answer, consider whether the rose plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.
The rose plant's genotype of gg has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait must be bush growth."

Question:
Does this passage describe the weather or the climate?
There are usually more days with low air pressure than high air pressure where Martha lives.

Choices:
A. weather
B. climate

Answer:","B
The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures.Read the text carefully.
There are usually more days with low air pressure than high air pressure where Martha lives.
Air pressure is caused by the weight of the air in the atmosphere. When the air pressure is low, the sky is usually cloudy. When the air pressure is high, the sky is usually clear.
This passage tells you about the usual pattern of air pressure where Martha lives. It does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."

Question:
How long is a hiking trail?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 2 kilometers
B. 2 centimeters

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.The better estimate for the length of a hiking trail is 2 kilometers.

B. When hung in the laundry room, do black cloth towels or white cloth towels dry more quickly?
C. Does a small cloth towel or a large cloth towel dry faster when hung in the backyard?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
I read that people with higher-paying jobs wear more expensive clothing. So, if I wear fancier clothes, I'll finally get that raise I've been wanting.

Choices:
A. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
B. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
C. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that expensive clothing will lead to a higher-paying job. However, that's not necessarily true. For instance, perhaps having a higher-paying job might lead someone to buy more expensive clothing. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as false causation."

So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Elijah's genotype for the Thomsen disease gene is mm. Elijah's genotype of mm has only m alleles. The m allele is for not having Thomsen disease. So, Elijah's phenotype for the Thomsen disease trait must be not having Thomsen disease.
To check this answer, consider whether Elijah's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having Thomsen disease (M) is dominant over the allele for not having Thomsen disease (m). This means M is a dominant allele, and m is a recessive allele.
Elijah's genotype of mm has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Elijah's phenotype for the Thomsen disease trait must be not having Thomsen disease."

What is the volume of a soda bottle cap?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 12 liters
B. 12 milliliters

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters.The better estimate for the volume of a soda bottle cap is 12 milliliters.
12 liters is too much."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
water evaporating from a lake
stretching a rubber band

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","D
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Stretching a rubber band is a physical change. The rubber band gets longer. But it is still made of the same type of matter as before.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But stretching a rubber band is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that the sled's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth () as Rose rode down the hill.

Hint:
Read the text about an object in motion.
On a snowy day, Rose rode her sled down a big hill.

Choices:
A. decreased
B. increased
C. stayed the same

Answer:","A
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the sled and the center of Earth changed.
The bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Rose started sledding. As Rose rode toward the bottom of the hill, the distance between the sled and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased as Rose rode down the hill."

Question:
Which piece of rope has less thermal energy?

Hint:
Two 20-gram pieces of rope are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. the colder piece of rope
B. the hotter piece of rope

Answer:","A
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two pieces of rope are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder piece of rope has less thermal energy."

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Since Laura Ellis became vice president of the parent-teacher association, student performance has declined and teacher morale is down. We on the school board believe that Ellis bears sole responsibility for the downtrend.

Choices:
A. red herring: the use of a completely unrelated topic or idea
B. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Laura Ellis is responsible for the decline in student performance and teacher morale. However, even though things declined after Ellis became vice president of the parent-teacher association, that doesn't necessarily mean that she caused the downturn. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as false causation."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Dutchess's phenotype for the ear type trait?

Hint:
In a group of American curl cats, some individuals have curled ears and others have straight ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for curled ears (E) is dominant over the allele for straight ears (e).
Dutchess is an American curl cat from this group. Dutchess has the heterozygous genotype Ee for the ear type gene.

Choices:
A. curled ears
B. straight ears

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Dutchess's phenotype for the ear type trait. First, consider the alleles in Dutchess's genotype for the ear type gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for curled ears (E) is dominant over the allele for straight ears (e). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
Dutchess's genotype of Ee has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Dutchess's phenotype for the ear type trait must be curled ears."

Question:
Is the following trait inherited or acquired?
Diana has naturally pale skin.

Choices:
A. acquired
B. inherited

Answer:","B
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits.Humans do not choose their skin color. Babies get their skin color from their parents. So, Diana's skin color is an inherited trait."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Estelle investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Estelle is sledding with her friends. She notices that some of them go faster down the sledding hill. She wonders what factors affect sledding speed. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
access to a small snow-covered hill at the park
a small plastic sled
a large plastic sled
a rubber inner tube sled
a stopwatch

Choices:
A. Does a rubber inner tube sled go faster down a small hill or down a big hill?
B. Does a rubber inner tube sled or a plastic sled go faster down a hill?
C. Does a plastic sled or a wooden sled go down a hill faster?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

What does the Eighth Amendment say about ""cruel and unusual punishments""?

Choices:
A. The government can only use cruel and unusual punishments against murderers.
B. The government can never use cruel and unusual punishments.
C. The government can use cruel and unusual punishments if it needs to.
D. The government can only use cruel and unusual punishments during wars.

Answer:","B
The Eighth Amendment says that the government can never use ""cruel and unusual punishments."" There are no special cases when they are allowed. What makes a punishment ""cruel or unusual""? The answer is not clear. The Eighth Amendment doesn't talk about specific punishments. Over time, Americans have changed their views on what is cruel and unusual. For example, the government decided in 2005 that it was cruel to put someone to death for a crime he or she committed before the age of 18. Today, Americans continue to question what is cruel and unusual. In the future, some punishments used today may be outlawed. The text of the Eighth Amendment is below. Does it have rules against anything else? Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."

How long is a human front tooth?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 14 meters
B. 14 millimeters
C. 14 kilometers
D. 14 centimeters

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.
A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length.The best estimate for the length of a human front tooth is 14 millimeters.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Don't ever get a ride from Mia. Her brother has been driving for only six months, and he's already gotten three speeding tickets.

Choices:
A. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
B. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Mia must be a reckless driver, because her brother is a reckless driver. However, even though Mia's brother is reckless, that doesn't necessarily mean that Mia is, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."

Question:
Does the sentence use a simile or a metaphor?
The new blanket was as soft as a kitten's fur.

Choices:
A. simile
B. metaphor

Answer:","A
Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.

Minnie, a Syrian hamster from this group, has straight whiskers. Minnie has two alleles for straight whiskers.

Choices:
A. HH
B. straight whiskers

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Minnie's observable version of the whisker type trait is straight whiskers. So, Minnie's phenotype for the whisker type trait is straight whiskers."

Question:
Complete the statement.
Cyclooctasulfur is ().

Hint:
Cyclooctasulfur is used in the production of rubber bands and automobile tires. The chemical formula for cyclooctasulfur is S8.

Choices:
A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Answer:","B
There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether cyclooctasulfur is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for cyclooctasulfur, S8, contains one atomic symbol: S for sulfur. So, the formula tells you that cyclooctasulfur is composed of only one chemical element.
Since cyclooctasulfur is composed of only one chemical element, cyclooctasulfur is an elementary substance."

Question:
What is the volume of a fish bowl?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 3 liters
B. 3 milliliters

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters.The better estimate for the volume of a fish bowl is 3 liters.
3 milliliters is too little."

Question:
Compare the motion of three ships. Which ship was moving at the highest speed?

Choices:
A. a ship that moved 100miles south in 10hours
B. a ship that moved 385miles south in 10hours
C. a ship that moved 160miles west in 10hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed.Look at the distance each ship moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each ship moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each ship moved for 10 hours. The ship that moved 385 miles moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that ship must have moved at the highest speed."

Question:
Which sentence is more formal?

Choices:
A. There are some things that Ms. Olson wants to bring up at the next city council meeting.
B. Ms. Olson has several important proposals to discuss at the next city council meeting.

Answer:","B
Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples
slang | cool, awesome
idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store
contractions | can't, won't
Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The first sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses overly simple or imprecise language (some things, bring up).
The second sentence uses more precise language, so it is more formal overall."

Question:
Which organizational structure does this text primarily use?

Hint:
Read the text.
In 1968, when the Democratic Party held its convention in Chicago to select a presidential candidate, the United States was at war in Vietnam. Thousands of Americans and Vietnamese had died in the war, giving rise to a growing anti-war movement. President Johnson, a Democrat, declined to run for reelection, in part because of the heavy opposition to his conduct of the war. Just months before the convention, both Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were assassinated, contributing to widespread unrest. Anti-war protesters wanted the Democratic Party to oppose the war, but they were excluded from the convention. This set off violent clashes between police and protesters on Chicago streets. The violence at the convention captured the nation's attention, strengthened the peace movement, and led to reforms in the nominating process.

Choices:
A. cause-effect
B. compare-contrast

Answer:","A
Authors use different text structures to organize their ideas in writing. Learning to identify these structures will help you to understand the relationships between ideas in informational texts. You can also use these structures to organize your own writing.
A cause-effect structure presents the causes and the effects of a particular event, trend, or situation. This structure often uses words and phrases such as because, since, as a result, due to, or consequently.
A compare-contrast structure presents similarities (comparisons) and differences (contrasts) between two or more things. This structure often uses words and phrases such as like, similarly, or in the same way (for comparing) or on the other hand, in contrast, or unlike (for contrasting).
A problem-solution structure presents a problem and suggests one or more possible solutions. This structure often uses words such as issue, question, puzzle, propose, and answer.
A sequential structure describes a series of events that happens in a certain order. This structure often uses specific dates and times or words such as first, next, during, finally, and while.The text uses a cause-effect structure to show the causes and effects of the violent demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago.

one wooden planter box in the shade
one plastic planter box in the sun
water

Choices:
A. Which type of sunflower grows more leaves?
B. Do sunflowers grow bigger in sunny planter boxes or in shady planter boxes?
C. Do sunflowers grow taller if they are planted in planter boxes or in pots?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Based on this information, what is this muskmelon plant's genotype for the fruit taste gene?

Hint:
In a group of muskmelon plants, some individuals have sour fruit and others have sweet fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit taste trait has two alleles. The allele F is for sour fruit, and the allele f is for sweet fruit.
A certain muskmelon plant from this group has sweet fruit. This plant has two alleles for sweet fruit.

Choices:
A. sweet fruit
B. ff

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The muskmelon plant has two alleles for sweet fruit (f). So, the plant's genotype for the fruit taste gene is ff."

A certain summer squash plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ll for the leaf texture gene.

Choices:
A. fuzzy leaves
B. smooth leaves

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The summer squash plant's genotype for the leaf texture gene is ll. The summer squash plant's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for smooth leaves. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be smooth leaves.
To check this answer, consider whether the summer squash plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for smooth leaves (l) is recessive to the allele for fuzzy leaves (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
The summer squash plant's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be smooth leaves."

When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Erin must be a reckless driver, because her brother is a reckless driver. However, even though Erin's brother is reckless, that doesn't necessarily mean that Erin is, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Lucia investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Lucia is sledding with her friends. She notices that some of them go faster down the sledding hill. She wonders what factors affect sledding speed. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
access to a small snow-covered hill at the park
a small plastic sled
a large plastic sled
a rubber inner tube sled
a stopwatch

Choices:
A. Does a rubber inner tube sled go faster down a small hill or down a big hill?
B. Does a rubber inner tube sled or a plastic sled go faster down a hill?
C. Does a plastic sled or a wooden sled go down a hill faster?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Choices:
A. oxymoron
B. hyperbole

Answer:","B
Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.
A euphemism is a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.
The head of Human Resources would never refer to firing people, only to laying them off.
Hyperbole is an obvious exaggeration that is not meant to be taken literally.

Question:
Select the solid.

Choices:
A. coffee
B. eraser
C. air inside a tire
D. air inside a bubble

Answer:","B
Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.Coffee is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour coffee into a different container, the coffee will take the shape of that container. But the coffee will still take up the same amount of space.
The air inside a tire is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air in a tire expands to fill all the space inside the tire. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the tire.
The air inside a bubble is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air inside a bubble fills all the space in the bubble. If the bubble pops, the air will expand to fill a much larger space.
An eraser is a solid. You can bend an eraser. But it will still have a size and shape of its own."

Question:
How long is the Nile River?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 6,850 kilometers
B. 6,850 centimeters

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.The better estimate for the length of the Nile River is 6,850 kilometers.

B. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
C. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist

Answer:","C
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

What do these two changes have in common?
baking cookies
water evaporating from a puddle

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","C
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking cookies is a chemical change. Cookies are made from cookie dough. Baking turns the cookie dough into cookies. The cookies are a different type of matter than the dough.
Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Water evaporating is a physical change. But baking cookies is not.
Both are chemical changes.
Baking cookies is a chemical change. But water evaporating from a puddle is not.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.To determine if there is a net force on Valeria, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Valeria down with a force of 600 N.
The seat of the cart is pushing Valeria up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Valeria."

Answer:","A
A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought. It can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause is not a complete thought. It cannot stand alone as a sentence.
the oranges on our tree are ripe
The clause can stand alone. It is independent.

The clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.
A simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.
Ben and I spent all day relaxing by the pool.
Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.
In the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.
Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw a flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard the rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause usually begins with a subordinating conjunction such as after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, or while.
If she ever gets the chance, Terri would love to visit the Egyptian pyramids.The second sentence is the compound sentence. It is made up of two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction so.

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can David investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
David went to a magic show. The magician rubbed a balloon on her hair and then held the balloon against a wall. When the magician released the balloon, David was amazed to see that it stuck to the wall! He wonders what factors affect how well balloons stick to different surfaces. So, he decides to design an experiment. He has the following supplies available:
the hair on his own head
a cotton blanket
a wooden door
five rubber balloons

Choices:
A. Do rubber balloons or foil balloons stick to the wooden door longer after being rubbed on his hair?
B. Do rubber balloons stick to a cotton blanket or a wooden door longer after being rubbed on his hair?
C. Do rubber balloons stick to a wooden door or a metal door longer after being rubbed on his hair?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.

Question:
Select the liquid.

Choices:
A. screwdriver
B. air inside a balloon
C. hammer
D. grape juice

Answer:","D
Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.The air inside a balloon is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air inside a balloon expands to fill all the space in the balloon. If the balloon pops, the air will expand to fill a much larger space.
Grape juice is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour grape juice into a different container, the grape juice will take the shape of that container. But the grape juice will still take up the same amount of space.
A screwdriver is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. This screwdriver has a metal blade and a plastic handle. Both metal and plastic are solids.
A hammer is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A hammer is made of iron and wood. Both iron and wood are solids."

South American farmers have just harvested their largest cocoa crops in years. Cocoa is a major ingredient in chocolate. What will probably happen to the overall supply of chocolate bars?

Choices:
A. The supply will probably go up.
B. The supply will probably go down.

Answer:","A
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.Cocoa is an important resource for making chocolate. If more cocoa has been harvested, cocoa will be easier to get. So, the supply of chocolate bars will probably go up."

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Tora, a leopard from this group, has a black coat. Tora has two alleles for a black coat.

Choices:
A. aa
B. a black coat

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Tora's observable version of the coat pattern trait is a black coat. So, Tora's phenotype for the coat pattern trait is a black coat."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
a piece of pear turning brown
acid rain weathering a marble statue

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","A
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
A piece of a pear turning brown is a chemical change. The substances in the pear react with oxygen in the air and turn into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown part of the pear, the inside will still be white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the pear.
Acid rain weathering a marble statue is a chemical change. The acid rain reacts with the outside of the statue and breaks it down into a different type of matter. This new matter is then washed away by the rain. Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when smoke from automobiles and factories mixes with water in clouds.
Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when automobiles and factories release smoke containing sulfur or nitrogen. Some of these chemicals react with water in the atmosphere. The reaction forms droplets of water that can fall back to the ground as acid rain.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

B. Heather's car was running terribly before she took it to the mechanic for a tune-up.

Answer:","B
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that the motorcycle's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the motorcycle and Earth () as Stefan rode up the hill.

Hint:
Read the text about an object in motion.
Stefan rode his motorcycle from the bottom of a hill to the top of the hill.

Choices:
A. stayed the same
B. decreased
C. increased

Answer:","C
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the motorcycle and the center of Earth changed.
The top of the hill is higher than the bottom of the hill. As Stefan rode toward the top of the hill, the distance between the motorcycle and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the motorcycle and Earth increased as Stefan rode up the hill."

An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Chance's phenotype for the fur texture trait. First, consider the alleles in Chance's genotype for the fur texture gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for rough fur (F) is dominant over the allele for soft fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Chance's genotype of Ff has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Chance's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be rough fur."

A. Maddie's neighbor has green eyes.
B. Maddie and her biological father wear sunglasses when they go outside.
C. Maddie has green eyes like her biological mother.

Answer:","C
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Question:
Look at the word. Does it have a closed syllable or an open syllable?
no

Choices:
A. open
B. closed

Answer:","A
Words are made up of syllables. Two kinds of syllables are closed and open.
A closed syllable has one vowel and ends with a consonant. It usually has a short vowel sound.
desk: short e
kit / ten: short i / short e
An open syllable ends with one vowel. It usually has a long vowel sound.
go: long o
he / ro: long e / long o
Some open syllables end with y. The y makes a long e sound or a long i sound.
sky: long i
ba / by: long a / long eThe word no ends with a vowel and has a long vowel sound. So, it has an open syllable."

"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that the submarine's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the submarine and Earth () as the submarine dove toward the ocean floor.

Hint:
Read the text about an object in motion.
A submarine dove hundreds of feet from the surface of the ocean toward the ocean floor.

Choices:
A. decreased
B. stayed the same
C. increased

Answer:","A
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the submarine and the center of Earth changed.
The ocean floor is lower than the surface of the ocean. As the submarine dove toward the ocean floor, the distance between the submarine and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the submarine and Earth decreased as the submarine dove toward the ocean floor."

Question:
Read the following excerpt from a student essay. How can the writer best improve his or her ideas and development?
Wearing a bicycle helmet is the best way to protect yourself against fatal head injuries. Several studies have shown that riders who wore helmets had a reduction in their risk of head and brain injuries. More and better bike lanes in our cities would help protect cyclists from danger. Children especially benefit from wearing helmets, since they experience the majority of bicycling accidents that cause serious head injuries.

Choices:
A. by including more evidence to support the claim
B. by removing a second main idea
C. by clearly stating the main idea

Answer:","B
During peer review, you read and respond to a fellow student's writing. While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:
Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?
Voice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?
Sentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?The writer could best improve his or her ideas and development by removing a second main idea.
For example, the writer could remove the underlined text and focus only on the main idea: the importance of wearing bicycle helmets.
Wearing a bicycle helmet is the best way to protect yourself against fatal head injuries. Several studies have shown that riders who wore helmets had a reduction in their risk of head and brain injuries. More and better bike lanes in our cities would help protect cyclists from danger.

Question:
Which type of sentence is this?
As Matthew sat down on the rickety old chair, it abruptly collapsed beneath him.

Choices:
A. simple
B. complex
C. compound
D. compound-complex

Answer:","B
A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence.
the oranges on our tree are ripe
The clause can stand alone. It is independent.
after we pick up Kevin from work
The clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.
A simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.
Ben and I spent all day relaxing by the pool.
Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.
In the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.
Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw the flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard a rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.

"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
a copper statue turning green
firing a clay pot in a hot kiln

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","D
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
Firing a clay pot in a hot kiln is a chemical change. High temperatures cause the clay to slowly harden. After several hours in the kiln, the clay will have changed into a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Firing clay is caused by heating. But a copper statue turning green is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Answer:","B
Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners.The second sales pitch is more formal. It uses more impersonal language. The other sales pitch uses idioms (blow you away!), and the direct address to the reader makes it sound more conversational."

Answer:","A
Organisms that carry out photosynthesis are called photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, these organisms use light energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce sugars and oxygen.
Photosynthetic organisms also often have the following characteristics:
They are producers, which are organisms that make their own food inside their cells. Because producers make their own food, they typically do not eat other organisms.
Their cells contain chloroplasts, which are cell structures where photosynthesis occurs.
Their chloroplasts often contain a green substance called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll captures light energy from the Sun to power photosynthesis.
They use the sugars they produce during photosynthesis as food. This food provides energy that helps the organisms live, grow, and reproduce.This organism is photosynthetic:

Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

Choices:
A. The supply will probably go down.
B. The supply will probably go up.

Answer:","A
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.Floods destroyed the cough drop factories in Silvergrove. The number of producers of cough drops went down.

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
President Townsend is an effective communicator, because he has a natural talent for speaking with people.

Choices:
A. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
B. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that President Townsend is an effective communicator because he communicates well. However, the ""evidence"" is just a restatement of the claim itself. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as circular reasoning."

Question:
What is the volume of an eyedropper?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 3 liters
B. 3 milliliters

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters.The better estimate for the volume of an eyedropper is 3 milliliters.

Question:
Based on this information, what is Rover's phenotype for the fur length trait?

Hint:
In a group of dogs, some individuals have short fur and others have long fur. In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele F is for short fur, and the allele f is for long fur.
Rover, a dog from this group, has long fur. Rover has two alleles for long fur.

Choices:
A. ff
B. long fur

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Rover's observable version of the fur length trait is long fur. So, Rover's phenotype for the fur length trait is long fur."

Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
This lunch meat has absolutely no additives, so it must be nutritious.

Choices:
A. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
B. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that the lunch meat is nutritious because it contains no additives. However, even though the lunch meat has no additives, that doesn't necessarily mean that it is nutritious. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as an appeal to nature."

Choices:
A. Does vegetable oil separate faster when stirred together with vinegar or with water?
B. Does vinegar separate faster when stirred together with olive oil or with coconut oil?
C. Does vegetable oil separate faster when stirred together with cold water or with hot water?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Compare the motion of two motorboats. Which motorboat was moving at a higher speed?

Choices:
A. a motorboat that moved 245miles in 10hours
B. a motorboat that moved 145miles in 10hours

Answer:","A
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed.Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One motorboat moved 245 miles in 10 hours.
The other motorboat moved 145 miles in 10 hours.
Notice that each motorboat spent the same amount of time moving. The motorboat that moved 245 miles moved a farther distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at a higher speed."

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:

Question:
Based on this information, what is Petunia's genotype for the fleece type gene?

Hint:
This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep:

In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele F is for a hairy fleece, and the allele f is for a woolly fleece.
Petunia, a sheep from this group, has a hairy fleece. Petunia has two alleles for a hairy fleece.

Choices:
A. FF
B. a hairy fleece

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Petunia has two alleles for a hairy fleece (F). So, Petunia's genotype for the fleece type gene is FF."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
a piece of pizza rotting in a trashcan
cooking an egg

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","A
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
A piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the pizza breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.
Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked eggs and raw eggs are made of different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking is caused by heating. But a piece of pizza rotting is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Answer:","B
Vertebrates and invertebrates are both groups of animals.
A vertebrate has a backbone. The backbone is made of many bones in an animal's back. A vertebrate's backbone helps connect the different parts of its body. In the drawings below, each vertebrate's backbone is colored orange.
An invertebrate does not have a backbone. In fact, invertebrates do not have any bones! Some invertebrates have an outer cover on their body called an exoskeleton. Other invertebrates have a soft body.A monarch butterfly is an insect. Like other insects, a monarch butterfly is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton.
A rainbow boa is a reptile. Like other reptiles, a rainbow boa is a vertebrate. It has a backbone.

Question:
What is the volume of a mustard bottle?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 9 gallons
B. 9 cups
C. 9 fluid ounces

Answer:","C
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon.The best estimate for the volume of a mustard bottle is 9 fluid ounces.

Compare the motion of three cars. Which car was moving at the lowest speed?

Choices:
A. a car that moved 250miles east in 5hours
B. a car that moved 65miles south in 5hours
C. a car that moved 300miles north in 5hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed.Look at the distance each car moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each car moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each car moved for 5 hours. The car that moved 65 miles moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that car must have moved at the lowest speed."

Knitting yarn into a scarf is a ().

Choices:
A. chemical change
B. physical change

Answer:","B
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.Knitting yarn into a scarf is a physical change.

Answer:","A
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.All three cherry pies have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 77°F pie is the coldest, it has the least thermal energy."

Assume all other forces on Natalie are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on Natalie?

Hint:

Choices:
A. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Natalie.
B. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Natalie.

Answer:","B
A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.To determine if there is a net force on Natalie, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Natalie down with a force of 600 N.
The seat of the cart is pushing Natalie up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Natalie."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Nuclear weapons are a threat to the stability and safety of the world. Like nuclear weapons, nuclear power plants rely on fission. Therefore, nuclear power plants are also a threat to the stability and safety of the world.

Choices:
A. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
B. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
C. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that nuclear power plants are a threat to world safety because they use the same process as nuclear bombs. However, this is not evidence that nuclear power plants are a threat to world stability. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."

When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.To determine if there is a net force on the cat, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling the cat down with a force of 40 N.
The bottom of the box is pushing the cat up with a force of 40 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 40 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the cat."

Is the following trait inherited or acquired?
Sidney has five fingers on each hand.

Hint:
Hint: Sidney was born with five fingers on each hand.

Choices:
A. acquired
B. inherited

Answer:","B
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits.Most humans are born with five fingers on each hand. So, having five fingers is an inherited trait."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
cutting an apple
a sidewalk heating up in the sun

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","D
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Cutting an apple is a physical change. The apple gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter as the uncut apple.
A sidewalk heating up in the sun is a physical change. The temperature of the sidewalk goes up, but the sidewalk is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
A sidewalk getting warm in the sun is caused by heating. But cutting an apple is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait?

Hint:
In a group of cucumber plants, some individuals have dull fruit and others have glossy fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit sheen trait has two alleles. The allele for dull fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for glossy fruit (f).
A certain cucumber plant from this group has the homozygous genotype FF for the fruit sheen gene.

Choices:
A. dull fruit
B. glossy fruit

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The cucumber plant's genotype for the fruit sheen gene is FF. The cucumber plant's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for dull fruit. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait must be dull fruit.
To check this answer, consider whether the cucumber plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for dull fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for glossy fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The cucumber plant's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait must be dull fruit."

Choices:
A. The supply probably went down.
B. The supply probably went up.

Answer:","B
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.The population of Millersburg fell by 8,000 people. Many of the people who have left are probably trying to sell their houses. Since more people are trying to sell their houses, the number of suppliers of houses for sale in Millersburg has gone up.

Compare the motion of two ships. Which ship was moving at a higher speed?

Choices:
A. a ship that moved 60miles in 5hours
B. a ship that moved 75miles in 5hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed.Look at the distance each ship moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One ship moved 75 miles in 5 hours.
The other ship moved 60 miles in 5 hours.
Notice that each ship spent the same amount of time moving. The ship that moved 75 miles moved a farther distance in that time. So, that ship must have moved at a higher speed."

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.

Which orange has more thermal energy?

Hint:
Two oranges are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. the colder orange
B. the hotter orange

Answer:","B
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two oranges are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter orange has more thermal energy."

An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence.
the oranges on our tree are ripe
The clause can stand alone. It is independent.
after we pick up Kevin from work
The clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.
A simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.
Ben and I spent all day relaxing by the pool.
Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.
In the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.
Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw the flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard a rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.
If she ever gets the chance, Terri would love to visit the Egyptian pyramids.
During his trip to Italy, Tony visited the Trevi Fountain, which is in Rome.
A compound-complex sentence is made up of two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.
After Samantha left work, she stopped at the bank, and then she went to the gym.
Sometimes a dependent clause in a complex or compound-complex sentence can interrupt an independent clause.

Question:
Complete the statement.
Hydrogen is ().

Hint:
Hydrogen gas was once used to make large airships, such as blimps, float. It is no longer used in airships because it catches fire easily. The chemical formula for hydrogen is H2.

Choices:
A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Answer:","B
There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether hydrogen is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for hydrogen, H2, contains one atomic symbol: H. So, the formula tells you that hydrogen is composed of only one chemical element.
Since hydrogen is composed of only one chemical element, hydrogen is an elementary substance."
"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Select the one animal that has all of the bird traits listed above.

Hint:
Birds are a group of animals with similar traits. The following traits can be used to identify birds:
They have feathers.
They have wings.
They have a beak.
They make eggs with shells. Observe the animals and read the descriptions.

Choices:
A. Galapagos giant tortoises hatch from eggs with shells and live on the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean. They can live to be over 150 years old! Galapagos giant tortoises have scaly, waterproof skin.
B. Common loons hatch from eggs with brown, spotted shells. They dive underwater and use their beaks to hunt food. They have feathers and two wings.

Answer:","B
Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.
How do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.
Birds have the following traits:
They have feathers.
They have wings.
They have a beak.
They make eggs with shells.
Compare each animal's traits to the group's traits. Select the animal with traits similar to the group's traits.
A Galapagos giant tortoise has the following traits:
It has scaly, waterproof skin.
It makes eggs with shells.
A Galapagos giant tortoise does not have all of the traits of a bird. A Galapagos giant tortoise is a reptile.
A common loon has the following traits:
It has feathers.
It has wings.
It has a beak.
It makes eggs with shells.
A common loon has the traits of a bird. A common loon is a bird."
"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
melting wax
rain forming in a cloud

Choices:
A. Both are caused by heating.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","D
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Melting wax is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Rain forming in a cloud is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air condenses into tiny droplets of liquid water. These droplets make up a cloud. When there is enough water in the air, the droplets will fall as rain.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Wax melting is caused by heating. But rain forming in a cloud is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Rain begins to form when water vapor in the air becomes liquid water. This is caused by cooling. But melting wax is not."

Question:
Which tray of lasagna has more thermal energy?

Hint:
Two trays of lasagna are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. the colder tray of lasagna
B. the hotter tray of lasagna

Answer:","B
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two trays of lasagna are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter tray of lasagna has more thermal energy."

Silver is ().

Hint:
Silver is a precious metal that is used to make many items, such as jewelry and coins. The chemical formula for silver is Ag.

Choices:
A. an elementary substance
B. a compound

Answer:","A
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether silver is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for silver is Ag. This formula contains one symbol: Ag. So, the formula tells you that silver is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, silver is an elementary substance."

Stuart is a Syrian hamster from this group. Stuart has the homozygous genotype hh for the whisker type gene.

Choices:
A. curved whiskers
B. straight whiskers

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Stuart's genotype for the whisker type gene is hh. Stuart's genotype of hh has only h alleles. The h allele is for curved whiskers. So, Stuart's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be curved whiskers.
To check this answer, consider whether Stuart's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Stuart's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Stuart's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be curved whiskers."

Compare the motion of two gray whales. Which gray whale was moving at a higher speed?

Choices:
A. a gray whale that moved 35kilometers in 5hours
B. a gray whale that moved 40kilometers in 5hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed.Look at the distance each gray whale moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One gray whale moved 40 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other gray whale moved 35 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each gray whale spent the same amount of time moving. The gray whale that moved 40 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that gray whale must have moved at a higher speed."

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Senator Serrano isn't lying when she says she cares about her constituents—she wouldn't lie to people she cares about.

Choices:
A. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
B. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
C. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Senator Serrano isn't lying about caring for her constituents because she doesn't lie to people she cares about. However, the ""evidence"" is just a restatement of the claim itself. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as circular reasoning."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
carving a piece of wood
sewing an apron

Choices:
A. Both are caused by heating.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","D
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric and thread that make up the apron get a new shape, but the type of matter in each of them does not change.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Select the gas.

Choices:
A. air from a hair dryer
B. tortoise shell
C. caramel sauce
D. pair of dice

Answer:","A
Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.The air from a hair dryer is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. A hair dryer uses a fan to blow warm air out. When the air leaves the hair dryer, the air expands to fill a much large space.
A tortoise shell is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A tortoise shell is made of a solid called keratin, just like your fingernails!
A pair of dice is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When you roll a pair of dice, the dice have a shape of their own. They are still cubes when they stop rolling.
Caramel sauce is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour caramel sauce into a container, the caramel sauce will take the shape of that container. But the caramel sauce will still take up the same amount of space."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Don't try to tell me that you only watch educational programming, Rebecca! I know for a fact that your sister only watches reality television.

Choices:
A. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
B. hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Rebecca must watch reality television, because her sister watches reality television. However, even though Rebecca's sister watches reality television, that doesn't necessarily mean that Rebecca does, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."

Which cookie has less thermal energy?

Hint:
Two cookies are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:

Answer:","B
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 1-kilogram brick at 70°F has half as much thermal energy as a 2-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the smaller brick has half as many atoms. So, it has half as much thermal energy.The two cookies are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder cookie has less thermal energy."

B. Snowy owls have sharp, curved beaks and live in cold places. They have feathers on their feet to protect them from the cold. Mother owls keep their eggs warm by standing on their shells.

Answer:","A
Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.
How do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.
Cartilaginous fish have the following traits:
They have fins, not limbs.
They live underwater.
They have a skeleton made of cartilage.
They make eggs with no shells.

It has feathers.
It has wings.
It has a beak.
It makes eggs with shells.
A snowy owl does not have all of the traits of a cartilaginous fish. A snowy owl is a bird.

Question:
Assume all other forces on Dylan are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on Dylan?

Hint:
Dylan is standing on a diving board at the pool. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Dylan with a force of 400N. The diving board is pushing up on Dylan with a force of 400N.

Choices:
A. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Dylan.
B. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Dylan.

Answer:","A
A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.To determine if there is a net force on Dylan, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Dylan down with a force of 400 N.
The diving board is pushing Dylan up with a force of 400 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 400 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Dylan."

Question:
Complete the statement.
Silicon dioxide is ().

Hint:
Silicon dioxide occurs naturally in the mineral quartz, which makes up many of the particles in sand. The chemical formula for silicon dioxide is SiO2.

Choices:
A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Answer:","A
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether silicon dioxide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for silicon dioxide is SiO2. This formula contains two symbols: Si for silicon and O for oxygen. So, the formula tells you that silicon dioxide is made of two chemical elements bonded together.
Substances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, silicon dioxide is a compound."

Question:
How long is a tennis racket?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 21 inches
B. 21 feet

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 8 long. You might be thinking, 8 what? Is the pencil 8 inches long? 8 feet? 8 miles?
The number 8 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are inches. So, the length of the pencil is 8 inches.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 1 inch is much shorter than 1 foot.
There are 3 feet in 1 yard. So, 1 foot is shorter than 1 yard.The better estimate for the length of a tennis racket is 21 inches.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
The Shahs argue we should eat our pizza with a fork and knife because it's less messy, but what do they know? Have you seen their house? It's a disaster!

Choices:
A. ad hominem: an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
B. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
C. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that the Shahs' opinion on eating pizza is invalid because their house is messy. This is a personal attack that isn't relevant to whether the argument is valid. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as ad hominem."
"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
photosynthesis
a penny tarnishing

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","C
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Photosynthesis is a chemical change. Plants make sugar using carbon dioxide, water, and energy from sunlight.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Hint:
Birds are a group of animals with similar traits. The following traits can be used to identify birds:
They have feathers.
They have wings.
They have a beak.
They make eggs with shells. Observe the animals and read the descriptions.

Choices:

B. Barn owls live on every continent except Antarctica. They have feathers, two wings, and a beak. They hatch from eggs with shells.

Answer:","B
Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.
How do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.
Birds have the following traits:
They have feathers.
They have wings.
They have a beak.
They make eggs with shells.
Compare each animal's traits to the group's traits. Select the animal with traits similar to the group's traits.

Question:
Based on this information, what is Cheyenne's phenotype for the coat color trait?

Hint:
In a group of cows, some individuals have a black coat and others have a red coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Cheyenne is a cow from this group. Cheyenne has the homozygous genotype ll for the coat color gene.

Choices:
A. a black coat
B. a red coat

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Cheyenne's genotype for the coat color gene is ll. Cheyenne's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for a red coat. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a red coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Cheyenne's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Cheyenne's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a red coat."

Question:
Which drop of honey has a higher temperature?

Hint:
Two drops of honey are identical except for their thermal energies.

Choices:
A. the drop of honey with less thermal energy
B. the drop of honey with more thermal energy

Answer:","B
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two drops of honey are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the drop of honey with more thermal energy has a higher temperature."

Using only these supplies, which question can Mandy investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Mandy gets a basketball for her birthday and dribbles it around her neighborhood. She notices that sometimes the ball bounces higher than other times. She wonders what factors affect how high her ball bounces. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
one basketball
access to a brick patio
access to a grassy lawn
access to a gravel driveway
a meterstick

Choices:
A. Does the basketball bounce higher on gravel or on grass?
B. Do larger basketballs bounce higher than smaller basketballs on a brick patio?
C. Does the basketball bounce higher on a lawn or on a dirt path?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners.The second letter opening is more formal. It uses the recipient's personal title and last name. The other opening uses the recipient's first name, suggesting a more familiar relationship."
"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Select the liquid.

Choices:
A. plate
B. gold bracelet
C. apple juice
D. tortoise shell

Answer:","C
Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.A tortoise shell is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A tortoise shell is made of a solid called keratin, just like your fingernails!
Apple juice is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour apple juice into a different container, the apple juice will take the shape of that container. But the apple juice will still take up the same amount of space.
A plate is a solid. If someone drops a plate, it may break into pieces. But each piece will still have a size and shape of its own.
A gold bracelet is a solid. You can wrap a gold bracelet around your wrist. But the bracelet will still have a size and shape of its own."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Shawn investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Shawn and his classmates are growing tomato plants in the school garden. He wonders what factors affect how tomato plants grow. So, he decides to design an experiment. He has the following supplies available:
three different types of tomato seeds
one bag of potting soil
five identical clay pots
water

Choices:
A. Which of the three types of tomato seeds sprouts the fastest?
B. Does a certain kind of tomato plant grow taller when planted in a clay pot or in a plastic pot?
C. Which type of soil will cause a certain kind of tomato plant to grow the most fruit?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Assume all other forces on Kimi are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on Kimi?

Hint:
Kimi is sitting on a roller coaster cart as it reaches the bottom of a big loop. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Kimi with a force of 600N. The seat of the cart is pushing up on Kimi with a force of 1,200N.

Choices:
A. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kimi.
B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Kimi.

Answer:","A
A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.To determine if there is a net force on Kimi, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Kimi down with a force of 600 N.
The seat of the cart is pushing Kimi up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kimi."

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Question:
Which wax candle has more thermal energy?

Hint:
Two 14-gram wax candles are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. the hotter wax candle
B. the colder wax candle

Answer:","A
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two wax candles are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter wax candle has more thermal energy."

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
People with larger houses live longer. I guess bigger homes are better for your health!

Choices:
A. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
B. ad hominem: an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
C. slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that larger houses lead to better health. However, that's not necessarily true. For instance, perhaps having a bigger home and better health care both result from being rich. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as false causation."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Biscotti's phenotype for the fur texture trait?

Hint:
In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight fur and others have wavy fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for straight fur (F) is dominant over the allele for wavy fur (f).
Biscotti is a Syrian hamster from this group. Biscotti has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene.

Choices:
A. wavy fur
B. straight fur

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Biscotti's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff. Biscotti's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for wavy fur. So, Biscotti's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Biscotti's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for straight fur (F) is dominant over the allele for wavy fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Biscotti's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Biscotti's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
rust forming on a metal gate
saliva breaking down a piece of bread

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","C
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is a chemical change. Bread is made up mostly of a chemical called starch. Saliva breaks the bonds between atoms in the starch molecules.
The atoms then link together to form smaller, simpler molecules of sugar. The sugar is a different type of matter than the starch.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.

Choices:
A. Both are caused by heating.
B. Both are only physical changes.

D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","D
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Milk going sour is a chemical change. The type of matter in the milk slowly changes. The new matter that is formed gives the milk its sour taste.
Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. Bread is made from dough. Baking turns the dough into bread. The bread is a different type of matter than the dough.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.

Question:
Which is a complete sentence?

Choices:
A. Over the summer, my cousin Reba visited many times.
B. Beavers build a dam they use sticks and branches.

Answer:","A
A sentence is a group of words that forms a complete thought. It has both a subject and a verb.
My friends walk along the path.
A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma.
I knocked on the door it opened.
It started raining, we ran inside.
To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
I knocked on the door, and it opened.
It started raining, so we ran inside.Over the summer, my cousin Reba visited many times is a complete sentence. The subject is my cousin Reba, and the verb is visited."

Question:
Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. If Fred doesn't know how to make homemade waffles, he can find the recipe in the cookbook.
B. If Fred doesn't know how to make homemade waffles, he can find it in the cookbook.

Answer:","B
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun it is used without its antecedent.
The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. It has been replaced with the recipe.

Question:
What is the volume of a car's gas tank?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 15 cups
B. 15 gallons
C. 15 fluid ounces

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon.The best estimate for the volume of a car's gas tank is 15 gallons.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
breaking a ceramic plate
knitting yarn into a scarf

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","A
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.
Knitting yarn into a scarf is a physical change. The yarn gets a different shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.

Sushi, a guppy from this group, has a golden body. Sushi has two alleles for a golden body.

Choices:
A. a golden body
B. bb

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Sushi's observable version of the body color trait is a golden body. So, Sushi's phenotype for the body color trait is a golden body."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
burning a candle
deep-frying chicken

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","B
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Burning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn. They react with oxygen in the air and turn into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.
Deep-frying chicken is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the chicken to change. Cooked chicken and raw chicken are different types of matter.

Compare the motion of three bicycles. Which bicycle was moving at the lowest speed?

Choices:
A. a bicycle that moved 115miles east in 10hours
B. a bicycle that moved 120miles west in 10hours
C. a bicycle that moved 280miles north in 10hours

Answer:","A
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed.Look at the distance each bicycle moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each bicycle moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each bicycle moved for 10 hours. The bicycle that moved 115 miles moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that bicycle must have moved at the lowest speed."

Choices:
A. The supply probably went up.
B. The supply probably went down.

Answer:","B
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.When four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, the number of suppliers went down.

Which piece of rope has more thermal energy?

Hint:
Two 15-gram pieces of rope are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. the hotter piece of rope
B. the colder piece of rope

Answer:","A
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two pieces of rope are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter piece of rope has more thermal energy."

Hint:
In a group of pea plants, some individuals have green pods and others have yellow pods. In this group, the gene for the pod color trait has two alleles. The allele for yellow pods (d) is recessive to the allele for green pods (D).
A certain pea plant from this group has the homozygous genotype DD for the pod color gene.

Choices:
A. yellow pods
B. green pods

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The pea plant's genotype for the pod color gene is DD. The pea plant's genotype of DD has only D allelles. The D allele is for green pods. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the pod color trait must be green pods.
To check this answer, consider whether the pea plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for yellow pods (d) is recessive to the allele for green pods (D). This means D is a dominant allele, and d is a recessive allele.
The pea plant's genotype of DD has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the pod color trait must be green pods."

A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma.
I knocked on the door it opened.
It started raining, we ran inside.
To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
I knocked on the door, and it opened.
It started raining, so we ran inside.The fog made it hard to see, Dad drove slowly is a run-on sentence. It has two sentences that are joined by just a comma: The fog made it hard to see and Dad drove slowly."

C. pushpin
D. fig tree

Answer:","D
All living things are made up of cells. Plants, animals, and some fungi have many cells. Other living things are made up of just one cell.
All living things need food and water. Water helps living things break down food and remove waste. Food gives living things energy. They use energy from food to grow and change.
All living things sense changes in their environment. Living things might sense changes by seeing, smelling, hearing, or feeling. Living things can respond to the changes they sense.A fig tree is a living thing.
Fig trees grow and respond to their environment. They need food and water. Fig trees are made up of many cells.
Fig trees are plants. They make their own food using water, carbon dioxide, and energy from sunlight.
An iceberg is not a living thing.
An iceberg does not have all the traits of a living thing. It may grow or melt in response to the world around it, but it does not need food.
A pushpin is not a living thing.
Pushpins do not have all of the traits of living things. They do not grow or respond to their environment. They do not need food or water.

Compare the motion of three bicycles. Which bicycle was moving at the highest speed?

Choices:
A. a bicycle that moved 155miles south in 10hours
B. a bicycle that moved 315miles north in 10hours
C. a bicycle that moved 325miles west in 10hours

Answer:","C
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed.Look at the distance each bicycle moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each bicycle moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each bicycle moved for 10 hours. The bicycle that moved 325 miles moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that bicycle must have moved at the highest speed."

Answer:","A
An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux.The source of the allusion Svengali is literature.
In George du Maurier's novel Trilby, Svengali is a hypnotist who exerts such power over the central character that she is suddenly able to sing, which she was unable to do before.
The allusion Svengali means a person with an unduly strong influence over someone else."

B. a 150-gram baked potato at a temperature of 40°C
C. a 150-gram baked potato at a temperature of 26°C

Answer:","A
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.All three baked potatoes have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 43°C potato is the hottest, it has the most thermal energy."

A chemical change occurs when new substances are formed from existing substances. This process is called a chemical reaction.
In a chemical reaction, one or more substances change into one or more different substances. During the reaction, the atoms of the original substances are rearranged to form other substances.
The original substances in a chemical reaction are called reactants. These substances react, or go through a chemical change.
The substances that are formed in a chemical reaction are called products. These substances are produced by the chemical reaction.
So, in a chemical reaction, reactants go through a chemical change to form products.Read the underlined text carefully. Look for information about what happens to water in this chemical reaction.

Choices:
A. The supply will probably go down.
B. The supply will probably go up.

Answer:","A
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.Floods destroyed the cough drop factories in Fairfax. The number of producers of cough drops went down. So, the supply of cough drops will probably go down."

B. Kiera's collection of handmade pottery was featured in last week's edition of the Springtown Journal, which identified her as ""one of the most unique young artists to debut this year.""

Answer:","A
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The first text uses unique in its traditional sense: being the only one of its kind.
Each vase and bowl in Kiera's collection of handmade pottery is unique. The colors and designs reflect both her cultural heritage and her individual artistic style.
The second text uses unique in its nontraditional sense: interesting or unusual. Kiera is a distinctive artist, but might not be one of a kind. It may be helpful to remember that if unique is modified by an adverb—as in most unique, very unique, or quite unique—it is probably being used nontraditionally.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
erosion caused by wind
beating an egg

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","A
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Erosion caused by wind is a physical change. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock. But the pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter.
Beating an egg is a physical change. Beating an egg mixes together the egg white, egg yolk, and some air. But mixing them together does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

In a group of horses, some individuals have Tobiano patterning and others do not. In this group, the gene for the Tobiano patterning trait has two alleles. The allele for having Tobiano patterning (B) is dominant over the allele for not having Tobiano patterning (b).
Casper is a horse from this group. Casper has the homozygous genotype BB for the Tobiano patterning gene.

Choices:
A. not having Tobiano patterning
B. having Tobiano patterning

Answer:","B
Casper's genotype for the Tobiano patterning gene is BB. Casper's genotype of BB has only B allelles. The B allele is for having Tobiano patterning. So, Casper's phenotype for the Tobiano patterning trait must be having Tobiano patterning.
To check this answer, consider whether Casper's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having Tobiano patterning (B) is dominant over the allele for not having Tobiano patterning (b). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Casper's genotype of BB has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Casper's phenotype for the Tobiano patterning trait must be having Tobiano patterning."

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Three key pieces of evidence prove that my client is innocent. First, she has not done anything wrong. Second, she is not guilty. And third, she is free from all criminal behaviors, dispositions, or inclinations.

Choices:
A. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
B. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
C. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that the client is innocent. However, the ""key pieces of evidence"" are simply three different ways of saying that the client is innocent. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as circular reasoning."

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Chip has one allele for straight fur (F) and one allele for wavy fur (f). So, Chip's genotype for the fur texture gene is Ff."

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that the sled's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth () as Julia rode down the hill.

Hint:
Read the text about an object in motion.
On a snowy day, Julia rode her sled down a big hill.

Choices:
A. increased
B. stayed the same
C. decreased

Answer:","C
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the sled and the center of Earth changed.
The bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Julia started sledding. As Julia rode toward the bottom of the hill, the distance between the sled and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased as Julia rode down the hill."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Becky investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Becky is outside with her friend on a sunny day. Becky is wearing a light-colored shirt, and she notices that she feels colder than her friend, who is wearing a dark shirt. She wonders what factors affect how fabric warms an object. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
a black cotton shirt
a white cotton shirt
two identical empty glass jars
two thermometers

Choices:
A. When placed in the sun, does a glass jar wrapped in a black cotton shirt heat up more than a glass jar wrapped in a white cotton shirt?
B. When wrapped in a cotton shirt and placed in the sun, does a large jar or a small jar heat up more?
C. When placed in the sun, does a glass jar wrapped in cotton heat up more than a glass jar wrapped in wool?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
mixing sand and gravel
crushing a mineral into powder

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","B
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Mixing sand and gravel is a physical change. Together, the sand and gravel make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Senator Logan announced today that she plans to cut funding to early childhood education programs. The last thing we need is a government official who hates children!

Choices:
A. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
B. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Senator Logan hates children, because she wants to cut education funding. However, the fact that Senator Logan wants to cut education funding doesn't necessarily suggest that she hates children. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man."

Gale, a budgerigar parakeet from this group, has blue body feathers. Gale has two alleles for blue body feathers.

Choices:
A. bb
B. blue body feathers

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Gale has two alleles for blue body feathers (b). So, Gale's genotype for the body feather color gene is bb."

"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Complete the sentence.
Beating an egg is a ().

Choices:
A. chemical change
B. physical change

Answer:","B
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.Beating an egg is a physical change. Beating an egg mixes together the egg white, egg yolk, and some air. But mixing them together does not form a different type of matter."

Answer:","C
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking cookies is a chemical change. The type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked. The cookie dough turns into cookies!
A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Baking is caused by heating. But a piece of avocado turning brown is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Last year, there were seven men's clothing stores on Main Street in Norwood. This year, there are only three. What probably happened to the overall supply of men's shirts in Norwood?

Choices:
A. The supply probably went up.
B. The supply probably went down.

Answer:","B
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.When four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, the number of suppliers went down. There were fewer stores selling men's shirts. So, the supply of men's shirts probably went down."

Question:
Does the sentence use a simile or a metaphor?
Mrs. Leonard is kind, and her heart is gold.

Choices:
A. metaphor
B. simile

Answer:","A
Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader.Mrs. Leonard is kind, and her heart is gold.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
If the government is allowed to start blocking websites, then soon they'll start banning books, and all we'll have to read is propaganda.

Choices:
A. slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences
B. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
C. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that blocking websites will eventually lead to having only propaganda to read. However, this isn't necessarily true. This argument offers only one extreme and unlikely outcome. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as the slippery slope fallacy."

B. The avant-garde artist deftly used neon colors and geometric patterns to create disorienting spirals so intense that they caused some viewers to become nauseous just from looking at them.

Answer:","A
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

B. a motorboat that moved 150miles north in 10hours
C. a motorboat that moved 250miles west in 10hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed.Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each motorboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each motorboat moved for 10 hours. The motorboat that moved 150 miles moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at the lowest speed."

Choices:
A. bright orange cheeks
B. RR

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Queenie's observable version of the cheek color trait is bright orange cheeks. So, Queenie's phenotype for the cheek color trait is bright orange cheeks."

Question:
Which holiday greeting is more formal?

Choices:
A. Happy 4th from the crew at Natalie's.
B. Best wishes for an enjoyable Independence Day from the entire staff at Natalie's Cafe.

Answer:","B
Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners.The second holiday greeting is more formal. It uses more elevated language (Independence Day, the entire staff). The other holiday greeting uses casual language (happy 4 th, the crew) that is more familiar in tone."

Question:
Why might a person have a limb amputated?

Hint:
If a person's body is damaged, the body can often heal itself. But sometimes, disease or injury can cause damage that is too severe to heal. When a limb is too severely damaged to heal, it may need to be amputated, or removed.
For example, a doctor can treat an infected limb with medicine. But if the infection does not go away, it can spread to the rest of the person's body. To stop the infection from spreading, the infected limb may need to be amputated.
In other cases, when a limb is badly injured, the skin, bones, muscles, and nerves may be severely damaged. If the damaged tissue cannot heal, it may die. The severely damaged or dead tissue then needs to be amputated.

Choices:
A. The limb has healed from a serious disease.
B. The limb cannot recover from an infection.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Did you really vote for Jayce as class treasurer? Didn't you hear that his uncle was imprisoned for embezzling $1.5 million?

Choices:
A. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
B. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Jayce can't be trusted with money, because his uncle embezzled money. However, even though his uncle couldn't be trusted with money, that doesn't necessarily mean that Jayce can't be trusted with it. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Emma investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Emma leaves a glass jar of cold tea outside in full sunlight. When she goes to get it, she notices that the tea is warm. She wonders what factors affect how warm a liquid gets from sitting in the sunlight. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
two identical glass jars
two jar lids
tap water
a measuring cup
two thermometers

Choices:
A. Will eight ounces of carbonated water or eight ounces of tap water get warmer when placed in a jar in the sun?
B. When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a closed jar or eight ounces of water in an open jar get warmer?
C. When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a glass jar or eight ounces of water in a plastic cup get warmer?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
What is the volume of a bathtub?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 335 milliliters
B. 335 liters

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters.The better estimate for the volume of a bathtub is 335 liters.

B. Denise made a random trip to the grocery store, though her kitchen was already stocked with a hodgepodge of food.

Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

Compare the motion of three ships. Which ship was moving at the lowest speed?

Choices:
A. a ship that moved 130kilometers south in 5hours
B. a ship that moved 220kilometers east in 5hours
C. a ship that moved 80kilometers north in 5hours

Answer:","C
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed.Look at the distance each ship moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each ship moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each ship moved for 5 hours. The ship that moved 80 kilometers moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that ship must have moved at the lowest speed."

All living things are made up of cells. Plants, animals, and some fungi have many cells. Other living things are made up of just one cell.
All living things need food and water. Water helps living things break down food and remove waste. Food gives living things energy. They use energy from food to grow and change.
All living things sense changes in their environment. Living things might sense changes by seeing, smelling, hearing, or feeling. Living things can respond to the changes they sense.A cave is not a living thing.
A cave may have animals or plants living inside. But a cave does not have all the traits of a living thing. A cave does not need food or water.

Which sentence is more formal?

Choices:
A. The muffins and sticky buns at Midtown Bakery are delicious.
B. The muffins and sticky buns at Midtown Bakery are to die for.

Answer:","A
Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples
slang | cool, awesome
idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store
contractions | can't, won't
Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses an idiom (to die for).
The first sentence uses formal language in place of the idiom, so it is more formal overall."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
butter melting on a hot day
mixing sand and water

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","B
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Mixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Butter melting on a hot day is caused by heating. But mixing sand and water is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Tiny's genotype for the eye color gene?

Hint:
In a group of guinea pigs, some individuals have brown eyes and others have red eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele E is for brown eyes, and the allele e is for red eyes.
Tiny, a guinea pig from this group, has red eyes. Tiny has two alleles for red eyes.

Choices:
A. red eyes
B. ee

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Tiny has two alleles for red eyes (e). So, Tiny's genotype for the eye color gene is ee."

Question:
Which of the following parts does an animal cell have?

Choices:
A. nucleus
B. cell wall
C. chloroplasts

Answer:","A
Plant and animal cells have many parts in common, but not all. This table shows some of their similarities and differences.
Cell part | Plant cell | Animal cell
cell wall | yes | no
cell membrane | yes | yes
cytoplasm | yes | yes
mitochondria | yes | yes
vacuole | yes | yes
chloroplasts | yes | no
nucleus | yes | yes

Select the one substance that is not a mineral.

Choices:
A. Gypsum is formed in nature. It is a pure substance.
B. Malachite is formed in nature. It is a solid.
C. Wool is made by living things. It is not a pure substance.

Answer:","C
Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that Edgar's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between Edgar and Earth () as he hiked toward the summit.

Hint:
Read the text about a person in motion.
Edgar hiked up a tall mountain. He followed a trail all the way to the summit.

Choices:
A. stayed the same
B. increased
C. decreased

Answer:","B
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between Edgar and the center of Earth changed.
The summit of the mountain was higher than the point where Edgar started hiking. As he hiked toward the summit, the distance between Edgar and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between Edgar and Earth increased as he hiked toward the summit."

What is the volume of a bathtub?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 320 liters
B. 320 milliliters

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters.The better estimate for the volume of a bathtub is 320 liters.

Question:
Select the liquid.

Choices:
A. chocolate syrup
B. ballet shoes
C. tortoise shell
D. hair clip

Answer:","A
Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.A hair clip is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. You can use a hair clip to keep your hair out of your face because the hair clip keeps its shape.
A ballet shoe is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When a dancer wears a ballet shoe, it may bend a little. But the ballet shoe still has a size and shape of its own.
Chocolate syrup is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour chocolate syrup into a container, the chocolate syrup will take the shape of that container. But the chocolate syrup will still take up the same amount of space.
A tortoise shell is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A tortoise shell is made of a solid called keratin, just like your fingernails!"

Which kind of place usually has taller buildings?

Choices:
A. an urban area
B. a suburban area

Answer:","A
People around the world live in three main kinds of places: urban areas, suburban areas, and rural areas.
An urban area is a city. It has many people and businesses. The buildings are close to each other. The buildings are often tall and have many floors. Since there are so many people, traffic is usually bad. People will walk or take the bus, train, or subway to avoid traffic.
A suburban area, or suburb, is near a city. It is quieter and less crowded than an urban area. People usually live in houses with yards. Most people drive to get places.
A rural area is less crowded than both urban and suburban areas. Houses are much more spread out. People usually have to drive to get places. People in rural areas often live on farms or ranches.
Some places, like small towns, don't really fit into any of the types. A small town does not have as many people as an urban area, but it has more people than a rural area. It is not near a city, so it is not called a suburb.Since there are more people in urban areas, the buildings are usually taller. Tall buildings can hold more people."

a wooden ramp three feet long and two feet tall
a cardboard ramp three feet long and two feet tall

Choices:
A. Do toy cars with plastic wheels go faster down the cardboard ramp than toy cars with metal wheels?
B. Does a big toy car go down the wooden ramp faster than a small toy car?
C. Do toy cars go faster down the ramp made of wood or the ramp made of cardboard?

Answer:","C
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

You never even finished law school, so why should I trust you to watch my children?

Choices:
A. ad hominem: a personal attack against one's opponent
B. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Last year, the city of Lanberry allocated more money to public parks. This year, however, littering increased, so the increase in park funding must have been responsible.

Choices:
A. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
B. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that increased park funding was responsible for an increase in littering. However, even though littering increased after funding to parks was increased, that doesn't necessarily mean that the funding was responsible. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as false causation."

A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma.
I knocked on the door it opened.
It started raining, we ran inside.
To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
I knocked on the door, and it opened.
It started raining, so we ran inside.Coach Sharma talked to her team before the game is a complete sentence. The subject is Coach Sharma, and the verb is talked."

Question:
Which figure of speech is used in this text?
Dr. Clayton is unhappy with her new assistant because simple tasks, like fetching coffee, take him years to finish.

Choices:
A. hyperbole

C. by replacing vague language

Answer:","B
During peer review, you read and respond to a fellow student's writing. While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:
Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?
Voice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?
Sentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?The writer could best improve his or her word choice by fixing misused words.
For example, the writer could replace the underlined words with capital and sights.

Compare the motion of two bowhead whales. Which bowhead whale was moving at a higher speed?

Choices:
A. a bowhead whale that moved 45kilometers in 10hours
B. a bowhead whale that moved 80kilometers in 10hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed.Look at the distance each bowhead whale moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One bowhead whale moved 80 kilometers in 10 hours.
The other bowhead whale moved 45 kilometers in 10 hours.
Notice that each bowhead whale spent the same amount of time moving. The bowhead whale that moved 80 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that bowhead whale must have moved at a higher speed."

Question:
How long does it take to make a paper airplane?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 50 seconds
B. 50 hours

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.

Mabel gets a basketball for her birthday and dribbles it around her neighborhood. She notices that sometimes the ball bounces higher than other times. She wonders what factors affect how high her ball bounces. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
one basketball
access to a brick patio
access to a grassy lawn
access to a gravel driveway
a meterstick

Choices:
A. Does the basketball bounce higher on gravel or on grass?
B. Does the basketball bounce higher on a lawn or on a dirt path?
C. Do larger basketballs bounce higher than smaller basketballs on a brick patio?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Bernard once fell asleep with the window open and woke up with a horrible migraine. Since then, he's always made sure to close his window before going to sleep.

Choices:
A. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
B. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
C. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.The two blocks of iron have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 75°C block is hotter than the 70°C block, it has more thermal energy."

Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses conversational language (real quick).

In a group of scarlet rosemallow plants, some individuals have red flowers and others have white flowers. In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f).
A certain scarlet rosemallow plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the flower color gene.

Choices:
A. white flowers
B. red flowers

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype for the flower color gene is ff. The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for white flowers. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.
To check this answer, consider whether the scarlet rosemallow plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers."

Question:
Which mug of cider has a lower temperature?

Hint:
Two 150-gram mugs of cider are identical except for their thermal energies.

Choices:
A. the mug of cider with less thermal energy
B. the mug of cider with more thermal energy

Answer:","A
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two mugs of cider are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the mug of cider with less thermal energy has a lower temperature."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Joseph investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Joseph mixes oil and vinegar to make salad dressing. He notices that after a few minutes, the oil and vinegar separate. He wonders what factors affect how quickly liquids separate. So, he decides to design an experiment. He has the following supplies available:
three glass bottles
olive oil
vegetable oil
vinegar
cold water

Choices:
A. Does vegetable oil separate faster when stirred together with cold water or with hot water?
B. Does vegetable oil separate faster when stirred together with vinegar or with water?
C. Does vinegar separate faster when stirred together with olive oil or with coconut oil?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

B. Last winter, Levi took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week.

Answer:","B
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The first text uses ironic in its traditional sense: contrary to what was intended, often in an amusing way. It's ironic because Levi tried to get away from the snow but found himself in a snowstorm regardless.
Last winter, Levi took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week.
The second text uses ironic in its nontraditional sense: marked by coincidence. It was a coincidence that Levi's friends were in Florida the week before.
Last winter, Levi took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, he just missed a few of his college friends, who had been in Florida the previous week.

Question:
Select the part whose main job is to give strength and stiffness to a plant cell.

Choices:
A. cytoplasm
B. chromosomes
C. cell wall
D. Golgi

Answer:","C
Plant cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.
Some cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:
Chloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.
The nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.
After proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.
In plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.
Other cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.
The cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.
On the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.
The cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts.The cell wall is the outer layer of a plant cell. It gives the cell strength and stiffness, which helps the cell keep its shape. The cell wall also supports and protects the cell."

B. When Molly was researching the lives of famous scientists, it said that Albert Einstein had a speech impediment when he was a child.

Answer:","B
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
I believe everyone has his or her own idea of what's beautiful in the world. After all, it's the individual who determines what's attractive according to his or her own opinion.

Choices:
A. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
B. hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations
C. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that everyone has his or her own idea of what is beautiful because the individual determines what's beautiful to him or her. However, the ""evidence"" is just a restatement of the claim itself. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as circular reasoning."

A. a motorboat that moved 105miles south in 5hours
B. a motorboat that moved 190miles west in 5hours
C. a motorboat that moved 30miles east in 5hours

Answer:","C
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed.Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each motorboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each motorboat moved for 5 hours. The motorboat that moved 30 miles moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at the lowest speed."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Mabel never lies. She told me herself, so it must be true.

Choices:
A. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
B. ad hominem: a personal attack against one's opponent

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Mabel is telling the truth because she says she never lies. However, the ""evidence"" is just a restatement of the claim itself. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as circular reasoning."

Question:
What is the source of the allusion in the sentence below?
Andrew described the situation he was facing with his boss as a catch-22.

Choices:
A. a song
B. literature

Answer:","B
An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux.The source of the allusion catch-22 is literature.
Joseph Heller coined the term ""catch-22"" in his 1961 novel of the same name. In the novel, if an army pilot wants to avoid dangerous missions, he must be deemed mentally unfit; however, his desire to stay safe proves his sanity, so he can never be excused from a mission. Heller called this sort of predicament or dilemma a catch-22.
The allusion catch-22 means a no-win situation."

Answer:","B
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits.Humans do not choose their natural hair color. Instead, children get their natural hair color from their parents.

Which object has more thermal energy?

Hint:
The objects are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. a cherry pie at a temperature of 110°F
B. a cherry pie at a temperature of 80°F

Answer:","A
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.The two cherry pies have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 110°F pie is hotter than the 80°F pie, it has more thermal energy."

Question:
Select the elementary substance.

Choices:
A. helium (He)
B. boron trifluoride (BF3)
C. fluoromethanol (CH3FO)

Answer:","A
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for fluoromethanol contains four symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, F for fluorine, and O for oxygen. So, fluoromethanol is made of four chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, fluoromethanol is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for helium contains one symbol: He. So, helium is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, helium is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for boron trifluoride contains two symbols: B for boron and F for fluorine. So, boron trifluoride is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, boron trifluoride is a compound, not an elementary substance."

Question:
Select the one substance that is not a mineral.

Choices:
A. Aquamarine is not made by living things. It is formed in nature.
B. Cotton is made by living things. It is not a pure substance.
C. Biotite is a solid. It is a pure substance.

Answer:","B
Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Aquamarine is a mineral.
Biotite is a mineral.
Cotton is made by living things. But minerals are not made by living things.
Cotton is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
So, cotton is not a mineral."

How long is a sunflower seed?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 15 millimeters
B. 15 meters
C. 15 centimeters
D. 15 kilometers

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.
A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length.The best estimate for the length of a sunflower seed is 15 millimeters.

Which sentence is more formal?

Choices:

B. The totally awesome movie Toy Story was the first full-length, computer-animated feature film.

Answer:","A
Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples
slang | cool, awesome
idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store
contractions | can't, won't
Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses slang (totally awesome).
The first sentence uses formal language in place of the slang, so it is more formal overall."

Complete the statement. Assume that the water balloon's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth () as the water balloon fell toward Alec.

Hint:
Read the text about an object in motion.
Clara dropped a water balloon off a balcony. The water balloon fell toward her friend Alec, who was standing below the balcony.

Choices:
A. stayed the same
B. decreased
C. increased

Answer:","B
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth changed.
Alec was lower than the balcony. As the water balloon fell toward Alec, the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreased as the water balloon fell toward Alec."

B. Before Jake decided on a double major in history and Russian literature, he talked to academic advisers about the requirements for each major.

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.

B. Do rubber balloons stick to a cotton blanket or a wooden door longer after being rubbed on his hair?
C. Do rubber balloons stick to a wooden door or a metal door longer after being rubbed on his hair?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

A certain fruit fly from this group has brown eyes. This fly has two alleles for brown eyes.

Choices:
A. ee
B. brown eyes

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The fruit fly's observable version of the eye color trait is brown eyes. So, the fly's phenotype for the eye color trait is brown eyes."

Poets often use the sounds of words to create interesting effects and to express moods and emotions. Understanding these elements of poetry can help you better interpret and appreciate poetic forms.
Anaphora is the repetition of words or sequences of words at the beginning of multiple phrases, sentences, or lines.
Out of the cradle endlessly rocking,
Out of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,
Out of the Ninth-month midnight
—From Walt Whitman, ""Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds. Often, assonance can create rhymes or near-rhymes within lines.
I wandered lonely as a Cloud
That floats on high o'er Vales and Hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host of golden Daffodils.
—From William Wordsworth, ""I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud""
Meter is a poem's rhythm, or the pattern of strong and weak syllables. Strong syllables are stressed, while weak syllables are unstressed.
A poem has an iambic meter when the beat sounds like da-DUM. A weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Occasionally, a line may begin with a strong syllable.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
A poem has a trochaic meter when the beat sounds like DUM-da. A strong syllable is followed by a weak syllable. Occasionally, a line may end in a strong syllable.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
—From Edgar Allen Poe, ""The Raven""
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.This poem uses onomatopoeia. It uses language that sounds like what it talks about."

Question:
Suppose Mason decides to bake blueberry muffins. Which result would be a cost?

Hint:
Mason is deciding whether to bake blueberry muffins or cranberry muffins. He wants the muffins to be tasty. But he also wants to make a lot of muffins.

Choices:
A. Mason will get to eat blueberry muffins. He thinks blueberry muffins are tastier than cranberry muffins.
B. Mason will give up some muffins. He could have made more cranberry muffins than blueberry muffins.

Answer:","B
Before you decide to do something, it is often helpful to list costs and benefits.
Costs are what you give up or spend when you decide to do something. Costs involve giving up things that you want or need.
Benefits are what you gain or save when you decide to do something. Benefits involve gaining something that you want or need.This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Mason wants or needs:
Mason will give up some muffins. He could have made more cranberry muffins than blueberry muffins."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle
shaking up salad dressing

Choices:
A. Both are caused by heating.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","B
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.
The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Shaking up salad dressing is a physical change. The different parts mix together, but they are still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Which type of sentence is this?
Because most wild orchids naturally affix themselves to trees and branches, planting an orchid in soil will likely kill it.

Choices:
A. simple
B. compound-complex
C. complex
D. compound

Answer:","C
A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence.
the oranges on our tree are ripe
The clause can stand alone. It is independent.
after we pick up Kevin from work
The clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.
A simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.
Ben and I spent all day relaxing by the pool.
Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.
In the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.
Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw the flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard a rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.
If she ever gets the chance, Terri would love to visit the Egyptian pyramids.
During his trip to Italy, Tony visited the Trevi Fountain, which is in Rome.
A compound-complex sentence is made up of two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.
After Samantha left work, she stopped at the bank, and then she went to the gym.
Sometimes a dependent clause in a complex or compound-complex sentence can interrupt an independent clause.
Orcas that are kept in captivity often have bent dorsal fins.The sentence is complex. It is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause begins with the subordinating conjunction because.

Question:
Based on this information, what is Louie's phenotype for the cheek color trait?

Hint:
In a group of cockatiels, some individuals have bright orange cheeks and others have pale orange cheeks. In this group, the gene for the cheek color trait has two alleles. The allele R is for bright orange cheeks, and the allele r is for pale orange cheeks.
Louie, a cockatiel from this group, has pale orange cheeks. Louie has two alleles for pale orange cheeks.

Choices:
A. pale orange cheeks
B. rr

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Louie's observable version of the cheek color trait is pale orange cheeks. So, Louie's phenotype for the cheek color trait is pale orange cheeks."

"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
How long is a leather belt?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 65 kilometers
B. 65 centimeters

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.The better estimate for the length of a leather belt is 65 centimeters.
65 kilometers is too long."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Mrs. Harmon, you point out that childhood obesity rates have skyrocketed, but are you aware that rainforests provide critical habitats for some of the world's rarest plants and animals?

Choices:
A. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
B. red herring: the use of a completely unrelated topic or idea

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that obesity rates and rainforests are somehow interconnected. However, these two ideas aren't related. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a red herring."

Richard enjoys feeding the squirrels in his backyard. He notices that they spend a lot of time collecting seeds and nuts. He wonders about what factors affect which foods squirrels choose to collect. So, he decides to design an experiment. He has the following supplies available:
two identical squirrel feeders
a bag of sunflower seeds
a bag of walnuts
a tree to hang the feeders from

Choices:
A. Do the squirrels eat walnuts from large feeders more often than from small feeders?
B. Which type of tree do the squirrels feed from most often?
C. Do the squirrels select sunflower seeds or walnuts more often?

Answer:","C
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Assume all other forces on Ken are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on Ken?

Hint:
Ken is standing on a diving board at the pool. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Ken with a force of 400N. The diving board is pushing up on Ken with a force of 400N.

Choices:
A. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Ken.
B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Ken.

Answer:","B
A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.To determine if there is a net force on Ken, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Ken down with a force of 400 N.
The diving board is pushing Ken up with a force of 400 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 400 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Ken."

Question:
According to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?

Hint:
Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
A fridge magnet is pulling on a paper clip.

Choices:
A. The paper clip is pulling on the fridge magnet.
B. The paper clip is pushing on the fridge magnet.

Answer:","A
According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force. This means that if one object is applying a force on a second object, the second object must also be applying a force on the first object, but in the opposite direction.
For example, if your hand is pushing down on a table, the table is also pushing up on your hand. Or, if you are pulling forward on a rope, the rope is also pulling back on you.The fridge magnet is pulling on the paper clip. So, Newton's third law tells you that the paper clip is pulling on the fridge magnet."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
water evaporating from a puddle
melting glass

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","C
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Melting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The glass changes from solid to liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Zuri's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?

Hint:
In a group of leopards, some individuals have a spotted coat and others have a black coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a black coat (a).
Zuri is a leopard from this group. Zuri has the heterozygous genotype Aa for the coat pattern gene.

Choices:
A. a spotted coat
B. a black coat

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Zuri's phenotype for the coat pattern trait. First, consider the alleles in Zuri's genotype for the coat pattern gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a spotted coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a black coat (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Zuri's genotype of Aa has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Zuri's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat."

The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the sled and the center of Earth changed.
The bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Tammy started sledding. As Tammy rode toward the bottom of the hill, the distance between the sled and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased as Tammy rode down the hill."

Question:
How long does it take for a pot of water to start boiling on a hot stove?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 10 hours
B. 10 minutes

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.

Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. Bill went on to calculus after studying trigonometry, but he never fully comprehended it.
B. Bill went on to calculus after studying trigonometry, but he never fully comprehended calculus.

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Don't be deceived by Emma Hammond's articles on rural, blue-collar workers. Her husband is a fancy investment banker, so she can't possibly understand their situation.

Choices:
A. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
B. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
C. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Emma Hammond can't understand rural, blue-collar workers because she is associated with an urban newspaper. However, where Emma works doesn't necessarily indicate anything about her ability to empathize. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Trisha's genotype for the sickle-cell disease gene?

Hint:
This passage describes the sickle-cell disease trait in humans:

In a group of humans, some individuals have sickle-cell disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the sickle-cell disease trait has two alleles. The allele A is for not having sickle-cell disease, and the allele a is for having sickle-cell disease.
Trisha, a human from this group, has sickle-cell disease. Trisha has two alleles for having sickle-cell disease.

Choices:
A. having sickle-cell disease
B. aa

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Trisha has two alleles for having sickle-cell disease (a). So, Trisha's genotype for the sickle-cell disease gene is aa."

Answer:","A
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.

Using only these supplies, which question can Santiago investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Santiago and his classmates are growing tomato plants in the school garden. He wonders what factors affect how tomato plants grow. So, he decides to design an experiment. He has the following supplies available:
three different types of tomato seeds
one bag of potting soil
five identical clay pots
water

Choices:
A. Which type of soil will cause a certain kind of tomato plant to grow the most fruit?
B. Does a certain kind of tomato plant grow taller when planted in a clay pot or in a plastic pot?
C. Which of the three types of tomato seeds sprouts the fastest?

Answer:","C
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether lithium bromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for lithium bromide, LiBr, contains two atomic symbols: Li for lithium and Br for bromine. So, the formula tells you that lithium bromide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since lithium bromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, lithium bromide is a compound."

Question:
According to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?

Hint:
Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
Sebastian is pulling on a full suitcase.

Choices:
A. The suitcase is pushing on Sebastian.
B. The suitcase is pulling on Sebastian.

Answer:","B
According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force. This means that if one object is applying a force on a second object, the second object must also be applying a force on the first object, but in the opposite direction.
For example, if your hand is pushing down on a table, the table is also pushing up on your hand. Or, if you are pulling forward on a rope, the rope is also pulling back on you.Sebastian is pulling on the suitcase. So, Newton's third law tells you that the suitcase is pulling on Sebastian."

Answer:","B
Every object is made of one or more materials. A material is a type of matter. Wood, glass, metal, and plastic are common materials.
A material has different properties. A material's properties tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells. Some examples of properties are shiny, hard, fragile, and stretchy.
For example, a shiny material reflects a lot of light. A fragile material breaks when you drop it.Flexible is a property. A flexible material can be bent without breaking easily.

How long is a soccer field?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 370 miles
B. 370 yards
C. 370 feet
D. 370 inches

Answer:","C
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using customary units, length may be written with units of inches, feet, yards, or miles.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot, and 3 feet in 1 yard. There are 5,280 feet in 1 mile.
A football is about 1 foot long. A football field is 100 yards long.The best estimate for the length of a soccer field is 370 feet.

Question:
Select the elementary substance.

Choices:
A. chloromethane (CH3Cl)
B. calcium (Ca)
C. phosphine (PH3)

Answer:","B
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for chloromethane contains three symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, and Cl for chlorine. So, chloromethane is made of three chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, chloromethane is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for calcium contains one symbol: Ca. So, calcium is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, calcium is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for phosphine contains two symbols: P for phosphorus and H for hydrogen. So, phosphine is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, phosphine is a compound, not an elementary substance."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
crushing a mineral into powder
dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","A
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.
Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Dry ice sublimating is caused by heating. But crushing a mineral is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

How long is a paintbrush?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 25 centimeters
B. 25 kilometers

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.The better estimate for the length of a paintbrush is 25 centimeters.

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Brad argues that American schools should offer foreign language classes at every level. I disagree. How could Brad not see the value of learning English?

Choices:
A. slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences
B. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
C. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Brad claims that Americans should stop learning English and only study foreign languages. However, this misrepresents Brad's argument. Brad only wants more foreign language instruction. He says nothing about eliminating English instruction. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man."

During peer review, you read and respond to a fellow student's writing. While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:
Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?
Voice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?
Sentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?The writer could best improve his or her narrative voice by adding dialogue.

Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

Question:
Compare the motion of two sailboats. Which sailboat was moving at a higher speed?

Choices:
A. a sailboat that moved 50miles in 10hours
B. a sailboat that moved 100miles in 10hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed.Look at the distance each sailboat moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One sailboat moved 100 miles in 10 hours.
The other sailboat moved 50 miles in 10 hours.
Notice that each sailboat spent the same amount of time moving. The sailboat that moved 100 miles moved a farther distance in that time. So, that sailboat must have moved at a higher speed."

Choices:
A. a ship that moved 190kilometers east in 5hours
B. a ship that moved 315kilometers west in 5hours
C. a ship that moved 325kilometers south in 5hours

Answer:","A
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed.Look at the distance each ship moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each ship moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each ship moved for 5 hours. The ship that moved 190 kilometers moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that ship must have moved at the lowest speed."

What information supports the conclusion that Clarence inherited this trait?

Hint:
Read the description of a trait.
Clarence has wavy hair.

Choices:
A. Clarence's biological parents have wavy hair.
B. Clarence uses a headband to keep his wavy hair out of his face.
C. Clarence's biological mother has long hair. Clarence also has long hair.

Answer:","A
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

B. a 175-gram glass of apple juice at a temperature of 40°F

Answer:","A
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.The two glasses of apple juice have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 65°F glass of apple juice is hotter than the 40°F glass of apple juice, it has more thermal energy."

The city of Georgetown has been one of the world's biggest makers of cough drops for many years. But last month, Georgetown's cough drop factories were destroyed by floods. What will probably happen to the overall supply of cough drops?

Choices:
A. The supply will probably go up.
B. The supply will probably go down.

Answer:","B
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.Floods destroyed the cough drop factories in Georgetown. The number of producers of cough drops went down.

Question:
In which place are cows, horses, and other livestock more common?

Choices:
A. a rural area
B. a suburban area

Answer:","A
People around the world live in three main kinds of places: urban areas, suburban areas, and rural areas.
An urban area is a city. It has many people and businesses. The buildings are close to each other. The buildings are often tall and have many floors. Since there are so many people, traffic is usually bad. People will walk or take the bus, train, or subway to avoid traffic.
A suburban area, or suburb, is near a city. It is quieter and less crowded than an urban area. People usually live in houses with yards. Most people drive to get places.
A rural area is less crowded than both urban and suburban areas. Houses are much more spread out. People usually have to drive to get places. People in rural areas often live on farms or ranches.
Some places, like small towns, don't really fit into any of the types. A small town does not have as many people as an urban area, but it has more people than a rural area. It is not near a city, so it is not called a suburb.Cows, horses, and other livestock are more common in rural areas. They need a lot of open space. Rural areas have a lot of open space.

Question:
Is this a run-on sentence?
Because penguins are frightened by humans and difficult to approach, researchers from the University of Strasbourg used remote-controlled rovers outfitted as baby penguins to study their subjects.

Choices:
A. no
B. yes

Answer:","A
A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.
There are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:
Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily since we have a concert in two weeks.This is not a run-on sentence. It is not formed from two sentences that have been run together without appropriate punctuation.

Question:
Based on this information, what is Walker's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?

Hint:
In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a).
Walker is a cow from this group. Walker has the homozygous genotype AA for the coat pattern gene.

Choices:
A. white spots
B. solid coloring

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Walker's genotype for the coat pattern gene is AA. Walker's genotype of AA has only A allelles. The A allele is for solid coloring. So, Walker's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring.
To check this answer, consider whether Walker's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Walker's genotype of AA has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Walker's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring."

Question:
Complete the statement.
Sodium iodide is ().

Hint:
Sodium iodide can be used to help treat certain types of cancer. The chemical formula for sodium iodide is NaI.

Choices:
A. an elementary substance
B. a compound

Answer:","B
There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether sodium iodide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for sodium iodide, NaI, contains two atomic symbols: Na for sodium and I for iodine. So, the formula tells you that sodium iodide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since sodium iodide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, sodium iodide is a compound."

Using only these supplies, which question can Sofia investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Sofia likes to skip rocks at the river. She notices that some of the rocks she throws skip off the surface of the water many times, while others skip once and then sink. She wonders what factors affect how well rocks skip on the water. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
10 small flat rocks
10 large flat rocks
access to the river by her school

Choices:
A. Do rocks skip more times when thrown across a river or across a pond?
B. Do small rocks or large rocks skip more times when thrown across the river?
C. Do round rocks or flat rocks skip more times when thrown across the river?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Answer:","C
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon.The best estimate for the volume of a washing machine is 36 gallons.

So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Moxie's genotype for the wool color gene is ll. Moxie's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for black wool. So, Moxie's phenotype for the wool color trait must be black wool.
To check this answer, consider whether Moxie's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for black wool (l) is recessive to the allele for white wool (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Moxie's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Moxie's phenotype for the wool color trait must be black wool."

Question:
Select the elementary substance.

Choices:
A. krypton (Kr)
B. potassium nitrate (KNO3)
C. sulfur dioxide (SO2)

Answer:","A
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for sulfur dioxide contains two symbols: S for sulfur and O for oxygen. So, sulfur dioxide is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, sulfur dioxide is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for krypton contains one symbol: Kr. So, krypton is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, krypton is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for potassium nitrate contains three symbols: K for potassium, N for nitrogen, and O for oxygen. So, potassium nitrate is made of three chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, potassium nitrate is a compound, not an elementary substance."

Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw the flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard a rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Steve investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Steve has a pet lizard. Steve notices that on some days, the lizard is active and runs around the tank. On other days, the lizard hardly moves at all. Steve wonders what factors affect how active his lizard is. So, he decides to design an experiment. He has the following supplies available:
one pet lizard
live crickets
live mealworms
one heating lamp

Choices:
A. Is the pet lizard more active when its tank is heated with one heating lamp or with two heating lamps?
B. Is the pet lizard more active when it is fed crickets or mealworms?
C. Is the pet lizard more active when it is fed insects or lettuce?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Answer:","A
An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux.The source of the allusion catch-22 is literature.
Joseph Heller coined the term ""catch-22"" in his 1961 novel of the same name. In the novel, if an army pilot wants to avoid dangerous missions, he must be deemed mentally unfit; however, his desire to stay safe proves his sanity, so he can never be excused from a mission. Heller called this sort of predicament or dilemma a catch-22.
The allusion catch-22 means a no-win situation."

According to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?

Hint:
Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
Pete is pulling on a full suitcase.

Choices:
A. The suitcase is pushing on Pete.
B. The suitcase is pulling on Pete.

Choices:
A. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
B. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
C. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Grace's work is low quality because her friend's work is low quality. However, the work of Grace's friend does not necessarily reflect the quality of Grace's work. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."

Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. Eva and her husband met Amy for lunch at a small café around the block from her office.
B. Eva and her husband met Amy for lunch at a small café around the block from Amy's office.

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
mixing chocolate syrup into milk
stapling an envelope shut

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","D
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change. The chocolate syrup and milk make a mixture. Making a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Stapling an envelope shut is a physical change. The envelope and the staple get new shapes. Both are still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Hint:

Captain is a cockatiel from this group. Captain has the heterozygous genotype Rr for the cheek color gene.

Choices:
A. bright orange cheeks
B. pale orange cheeks

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Captain's phenotype for the cheek color trait. First, consider the alleles in Captain's genotype for the cheek color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.
Captain's genotype of Rr has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Captain's phenotype for the cheek color trait must be bright orange cheeks."

Question:
According to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?

Hint:
Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
Helen's foot is pushing on her car's gas pedal.

Choices:
A. The gas pedal is pulling on Helen's foot.
B. The gas pedal is pushing on Helen's foot.

Answer:","B
According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force. This means that if one object is applying a force on a second object, the second object must also be applying a force on the first object, but in the opposite direction.
For example, if your hand is pushing down on a table, the table is also pushing up on your hand. Or, if you are pulling forward on a rope, the rope is also pulling back on you.Helen's foot is pushing on the gas pedal. So, Newton's third law tells you that the gas pedal is pushing on Helen's foot."

Question:
Compare the motion of two ships. Which ship was moving at a lower speed?

Choices:
A. a ship that moved 350kilometers in 5hours
B. a ship that moved 245kilometers in 5hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.Look at the distance each ship moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One ship moved 245 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other ship moved 350 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each ship spent the same amount of time moving. The ship that moved 245 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that ship must have moved at a lower speed."

Question:
Which water balloon has more thermal energy?

Hint:
Two water balloons are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. the colder water balloon
B. the hotter water balloon

Answer:","B
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two water balloons are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter water balloon has more thermal energy."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
a piece of pizza rotting in a trashcan
burning a candle

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","B
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
A piece of pizza rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the pizza breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.
Burning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn. They react with oxygen in the air and turn into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Burning is caused by heating. But a piece of pizza rotting is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Which sentence is more formal?

Choices:
A. Mars's atmosphere is not thick enough to trap the sun's heat, so the planet gets quite cold.
B. Mars gets real cold because its atmosphere does not trap the sun's heat.

Answer:","A
Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples
slang | cool, awesome
idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store
contractions | can't, won't
Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses conversational language (real).

Question:
In which place would you usually find more farms?

Choices:
A. a suburban area
B. a rural area

Answer:","B
People around the world live in three main kinds of places: urban areas, suburban areas, and rural areas.
An urban area is a city. It has many people and businesses. The buildings are close to each other. The buildings are often tall and have many floors. Since there are so many people, traffic is usually bad. People will walk or take the bus, train, or subway to avoid traffic.
A suburban area, or suburb, is near a city. It is quieter and less crowded than an urban area. People usually live in houses with yards. Most people drive to get places.
A rural area is less crowded than both urban and suburban areas. Houses are much more spread out. People usually have to drive to get places. People in rural areas often live on farms or ranches.
Some places, like small towns, don't really fit into any of the types. A small town does not have as many people as an urban area, but it has more people than a rural area. It is not near a city, so it is not called a suburb.Farms are almost always in rural areas. They take up a lot of space. Rural areas have a lot of open space. There aren't many buildings or people."

Answer:","C
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."
