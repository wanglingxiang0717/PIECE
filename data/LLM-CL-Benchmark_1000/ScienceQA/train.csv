Question:
Complete the statement.
Palladium is ().

Hint:
Palladium is a metal that reacts with the gases produced by car engines to make the gases less harmful. The chemical formula for palladium is Pd.

Choices:
A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Answer:","B
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether palladium is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for palladium is Pd. This formula contains one symbol: Pd. So, the formula tells you that palladium is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, palladium is an elementary substance."

Question:
Which object has more thermal energy?

Hint:
The objects are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. a 700-gram rock at a temperature of 125°F
B. a 700-gram rock at a temperature of 165°F

Answer:","B
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.The two rocks have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 165°F rock is hotter than the 125°F rock, it has more thermal energy."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Kevin's phenotype for the Marfan syndrome trait?

Hint:
This passage describes the Marfan syndrome trait in humans:

In a group of humans, some individuals have Marfan syndrome and others do not. In this group, the gene for the Marfan syndrome trait has two alleles. The allele for not having Marfan syndrome (m) is recessive to the allele for having Marfan syndrome (M).
Kevin is a human from this group. Kevin has the homozygous genotype mm for the Marfan syndrome gene.

Choices:
A. having Marfan syndrome
B. not having Marfan syndrome

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Kevin's genotype for the Marfan syndrome gene is mm. Kevin's genotype of mm has only m alleles. The m allele is for not having Marfan syndrome. So, Kevin's phenotype for the Marfan syndrome trait must be not having Marfan syndrome.
To check this answer, consider whether Kevin's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having Marfan syndrome (m) is recessive to the allele for having Marfan syndrome (M). This means M is a dominant allele, and m is a recessive allele.
Kevin's genotype of mm has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Kevin's phenotype for the Marfan syndrome trait must be not having Marfan syndrome."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
tying a shoelace
breaking a piece of glass

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","B
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Tying a shoelace is a physical change. The shoelace gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Breaking a piece of glass is a physical change. The glass gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Select the part whose main job is to help an animal cell make proteins.

Choices:
A. vacuoles
B. endoplasmic reticulum
C. mitochondria
D. cytoplasm

Answer:","B
Animal cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.
Some cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in animal cells:
Mitochondria help the cell get the energy it needs. Mitochondria break down sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.
The nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.
After proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.
Animal cells also have organelles for storage and waste removal. The vacuoles store sugar and other nutrients. The lysosomes break down worn-out cell parts and other waste. Animal cells usually have several vacuoles and lysosomes.
Other cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.
The cell membrane is a thin layer that surrounds and protects the cell. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.
The cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts.The endoplasmic reticulum helps the cell make proteins. Instructions for making proteins are sent to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum and use the instructions to make proteins."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
pouring milk on oatmeal
sanding a piece of wood

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","A
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Pouring milk on oatmeal is a physical change. The oatmeal and milk form a creamy mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Sanding a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood becomes smoother, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."
"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that the motorcycle's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the motorcycle and Earth () as Bryan rode up the hill.

Hint:
Read the text about an object in motion.
Bryan rode his motorcycle from the bottom of a hill to the top of the hill.

Choices:
A. stayed the same
B. increased
C. decreased

Answer:","B
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the motorcycle and the center of Earth changed.
The top of the hill is higher than the bottom of the hill. As Bryan rode toward the top of the hill, the distance between the motorcycle and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the motorcycle and Earth increased as Bryan rode up the hill."

Question:
How long is a paintbrush?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 30 meters
B. 30 centimeters

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.The better estimate for the length of a paintbrush is 30 centimeters.

Question:
According to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?

Hint:
Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
A horseshoe magnet is pulling on a metal screw.

Choices:
A. The metal screw is pulling on the horseshoe magnet.
B. The metal screw is pushing on the horseshoe magnet.

Answer:","A
According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force. This means that if one object is applying a force on a second object, the second object must also be applying a force on the first object, but in the opposite direction.
For example, if your hand is pushing down on a table, the table is also pushing up on your hand. Or, if you are pulling forward on a rope, the rope is also pulling back on you.The horseshoe magnet is pulling on the metal screw. So, Newton's third law tells you that the metal screw is pulling on the horseshoe magnet."

Answer:","C
Solid and liquid are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a shape of its own.
Some solids can be bent or broken easily. Others are hard to bend or break.
A glass cup is a solid. A sock is also a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it takes the shape of its container.
Think about pouring a liquid from a cup into a bottle. The shape of the liquid is different in the cup than in the bottle. But the liquid still takes up the same amount of space.

Choices:
A. no
B. yes

Answer:","A
A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.
There are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:
Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.

Question:
The mom and dad push the strollers at the same speed. Which stroller is pushed with a larger force?

Hint:
A mom, a dad, and two kids are going for a walk. The mom and the dad each push one of the kids in a stroller. The strollers are the same. But the kids are different sizes.

Choices:
A. a stroller with kid that weighs 20 pounds
B. a stroller with kid that weighs 25 pounds

Answer:","B
A force is a push or a pull.
A force can make an object start moving or stop an object that is moving. A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.
Forces can be different sizes.
Think about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object.Look for the stroller that is heavier.
A stroller holding a kid that weighs 25 pounds is heavier than a stroller holding a kid that weighs 20 pounds. So, the stroller holding the kid that weighs 25 pounds needs to be pushed with a larger force to start moving forward at the same speed as the other other stroller."

Question:
How long is a hammer?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 8 inches
B. 8 yards

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 8 long. You might be thinking, 8 what? Is the pencil 8 inches long? 8 feet? 8 miles?
The number 8 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are inches. So, the length of the pencil is 8 inches.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 1 inch is much shorter than 1 foot.
There are 3 feet in 1 yard. So, 1 foot is shorter than 1 yard.The better estimate for the length of a hammer is 8 inches.
8 yards is too long."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Right after Vince moved into the apartment, our washing machine broke. He'd better tell us how he broke it.

Choices:
A. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
B. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Vince is responsible for the broken washing machine. However, the fact that the machine stopped working soon after Vince moved in doesn't necessarily mean that he caused the machine to break. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as false causation."

Question:
Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait?

Hint:
In a group of cucumber plants, some individuals have dull fruit and others have glossy fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit sheen trait has two alleles. The allele for dull fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for glossy fruit (f).
A certain cucumber plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the fruit sheen gene.

Choices:
A. glossy fruit
B. dull fruit

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The cucumber plant's genotype for the fruit sheen gene is ff. The cucumber plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for glossy fruit. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait must be glossy fruit.
To check this answer, consider whether the cucumber plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for dull fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for glossy fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The cucumber plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait must be glossy fruit."

An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait. First, consider the alleles in the plant's genotype for the stem height gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a short stem (h) is recessive to the allele for a tall stem (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
The pea plant's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait must be a tall stem."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Right after Edgar moved into the apartment, our washing machine broke. He'd better tell us how he broke it.

Choices:
A. ad hominem: a personal attack against one's opponent
B. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Edgar is responsible for the broken washing machine. However, the fact that the machine stopped working soon after Edgar moved in doesn't necessarily mean that he caused the machine to break. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as false causation."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
melting wax
snowflakes forming in a cloud

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","C
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Melting wax is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Snowflakes forming in a cloud is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Wax melting is caused by heating. But snowflakes forming in a cloud is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
A snowflake begins to form when a tiny drop of liquid water in a cloud freezes. This is caused by cooling. But melting wax is not."

Hint:
Read the description of a trait.
Steven has a scar on his right arm.

Choices:
A. Some scars fade more quickly than others.
B. Steven's scar was caused by an accident. He cut his arm when he fell off his bicycle.

Answer:","B
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Compare the motion of three cars. Which car was moving at the lowest speed?

Choices:
A. a car that moved 220miles south in 5hours
B. a car that moved 195miles east in 5hours
C. a car that moved 210miles east in 5hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed.Look at the distance each car moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each car moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each car moved for 5 hours. The car that moved 195 miles moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that car must have moved at the lowest speed."

Question:
According to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?

Hint:
Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
Lee is pushing on his friend's wheelchair.

Choices:
A. The wheelchair is pushing on Lee.
B. The wheelchair is pulling on Lee.

Answer:","A
According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force. This means that if one object is applying a force on a second object, the second object must also be applying a force on the first object, but in the opposite direction.
For example, if your hand is pushing down on a table, the table is also pushing up on your hand. Or, if you are pulling forward on a rope, the rope is also pulling back on you.Lee is pushing on the wheelchair. So, Newton's third law tells you that the wheelchair is pushing on Lee."

Choices:
A. no
B. yes

Answer:","B
A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.
There are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:
Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.

Question:
Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the fruit taste trait?

Hint:
In a group of muskmelon plants, some individuals have sour fruit and others have sweet fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit taste trait has two alleles. The allele for sour fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for sweet fruit (f).
A certain muskmelon plant from this group has the heterozygous genotype Ff for the fruit taste gene.

Choices:
A. sweet fruit
B. sour fruit

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine the muskmelon plant's phenotype for the fruit taste trait. First, consider the alleles in the plant's genotype for the fruit taste gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for sour fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for sweet fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The muskmelon plant's genotype of Ff has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the muskmelon plant's phenotype for the fruit taste trait must be sour fruit."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
I'm never setting foot in any seafood restaurant again. We just had a ridiculously overpriced dinner at Max's Seafood Hut, and I have no interest in repeating that experience.

Choices:
A. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
B. hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that all seafood restaurants are overpriced. However, even though one seafood restaurant was overpriced, that doesn't necessarily mean that all seafood restaurants are overpriced. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a hasty generalization."

Question:
Which text uses the word ironic in its traditional sense?

Choices:
A. Last winter, Reid took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week.
B. Last winter, Reid took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, he just missed a few of his college friends, who had been in Florida the previous week.

Answer:","A
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The first text uses ironic in its traditional sense: contrary to what was intended, often in an amusing way. It's ironic because Reid tried to get away from the snow but found himself in a snowstorm regardless.
Last winter, Reid took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week.
The second text uses ironic in its nontraditional sense: marked by coincidence. It was a coincidence that Reid's friends were in Florida the week before.
Last winter, Reid took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, he just missed a few of his college friends, who had been in Florida the previous week.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word ironic because it is generally considered incorrect."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
silver jewelry tarnishing
baking a loaf of bread

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","B
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. Silver jewelry tarnishing is a chemical change. The silver reacts with sulfur in the air to form black tarnish. The tarnish is a different type of matter that was not there before the change.
Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. The type of matter in the dough changes when it is baked. The dough turns into bread!
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Baking is caused by heating. But silver tarnishing is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Select the elementary substance.

Choices:
A. fluoromethane (CH3F)
B. copper (Cu)
C. hydrogen sulfide (H2S)

Answer:","B
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for fluoromethane contains three symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, and F for fluorine. So, fluoromethane is made of three chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, fluoromethane is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for hydrogen sulfide contains two symbols: H for hydrogen and S for sulfur. So, hydrogen sulfide is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, hydrogen sulfide is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for copper contains one symbol: Cu. So, copper is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, copper is an elementary substance."

Question:
How long is an apple seed?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 6 kilometers
B. 6 centimeters
C. 6 millimeters

Answer:","C
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.
A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length.The best estimate for the length of an apple seed is 6 millimeters.

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that the motorcycle's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the motorcycle and Earth () as Rodrigo rode up the hill.

Hint:
Read the text about an object in motion.
Rodrigo rode his motorcycle from the bottom of a hill to the top of the hill.

Choices:
A. decreased
B. increased
C. stayed the same

Answer:","B
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the motorcycle and the center of Earth changed.
The top of the hill is higher than the bottom of the hill. As Rodrigo rode toward the top of the hill, the distance between the motorcycle and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the motorcycle and Earth increased as Rodrigo rode up the hill."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
molding clay into the shape of a pot
a rock heating up in a campfire

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","D
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Molding clay into the shape of a pot is a physical change. The clay gets a different shape. But it is made of the same type of matter.
A rock heating up in a campfire is a physical change. The temperature of the rock goes up, but the rock is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
A rock heating up in a campfire is caused by heating. But molding clay is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Answer:","A
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits.Humans do not choose their natural hair color. Instead, children get their natural hair color from their parents.

All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.The two glasses of orange juice have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 40°F glass of orange juice is colder than the 45°F glass of orange juice, it has less thermal energy."

Question:
Read the following text from a student essay. How can the writer best improve his or her organization?
In the 1800s, egrets were hunted in the United States for their long white plumes (feathers). As a result, the birds were nearly wiped out completely. Thankfully, conservation measures were put in place, and the birds were protected. In fact, in recent years, egrets have expanded their range northward, moving beyond their original habitat in the American South. The egret is a large white bird that lives near marshes, lakes, ponds, and other wetland areas.

Choices:
A. by providing the description of egrets when they are first introduced
B. by removing the sentence about the egrets' expanded range

Answer:","A
When you review a fellow student's writing, try to make your feedback clear and specific. You can use questions such as the following to guide your feedback:
Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear main idea and develop it with evidence, examples, and analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that the ideas build on one another and are easy to follow?
Sentence fluency: Do the writer's sentences vary in structure and length, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely, avoiding excessive repetition or inappropriate language to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer use accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?The writer could best improve his or her organization by providing the description of egrets when they are first introduced.
For example, the writer could move the underlined text to the beginning of the paragraph.

Answer:","A
Poetry is a special kind of writing. It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.
A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel
In vest of shining white,
In coat of silver gray,
And vest of shining white.
—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, ""The Flying Squirrel""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring""This poem uses end rhyme. Its rhymes come at the end of its lines.
Toward her people from foreign wrong:
Live in the colors to stand or fall."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
I used to love this TV show, but then I found out that Shane likes it, too. So I changed my opinion—if someone like Shane likes a show, it can't be as good as I thought!

Choices:
A. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
B. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
C. slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that a television show must be bad because someone the speaker hates enjoys it. However, this is not evidence that the show is bad. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."

What do these two changes have in common?
boiling sugar to make caramel
water boiling on a stove

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","B
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Boiling sugar to make caramel is a chemical change. The heat causes the sugar to change into a different type of matter. Unlike sugar, the new matter is brown and sticky.
Water boiling on the stove is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Water boiling is a physical change. But boiling sugar to make caramel is not.
Both are chemical changes.

Choices:
A. Everyone seemed to enjoy the magnolia-scented candle, but it made Larry feel rather nauseous.
B. Everyone seemed to enjoy the magnolia-scented candle, but Larry found the smell rather nauseous.

Answer:","B
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The second text uses nauseous in its traditional sense: causing disgust or nausea.
Everyone seemed to enjoy the magnolia-scented candle, but Larry found the smell rather nauseous.
The first text uses nauseous in its nontraditional sense: feeling disgusted or nauseated.

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Luke investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Luke and his sister are building ramps to race their toy cars down. Luke notices that the cars go down some of the ramps faster than others. He wonders what factors affect the cars' speed. So, he decides to design an experiment. He has the following supplies available:
two identical toy cars
a wooden ramp three feet long and two feet tall
a cardboard ramp three feet long and two feet tall

Choices:
A. Do toy cars with plastic wheels go faster down the cardboard ramp than toy cars with metal wheels?
B. Do toy cars go faster down the ramp made of wood or the ramp made of cardboard?
C. Does a big toy car go down the wooden ramp faster than a small toy car?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that Patrick's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between Patrick and Earth () as he rode the escalator.

Hint:
Read the text about a person in motion.
Patrick rode an escalator from the first floor to the second floor of a shopping mall.

Choices:
A. decreased
B. increased
C. stayed the same

Answer:","B
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between Patrick and the center of Earth changed.
The second floor is higher than the first floor. As he rode the escalator toward the second floor, the distance between Patrick and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between Patrick and Earth increased as he rode the escalator."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
a banana getting ripe on the counter
plants making food from sunlight, air, and water

Choices:
A. Both are caused by heating.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","D
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
A banana getting ripe on the counter is a chemical change. As a banana ripens, the type of matter in it changes. The peel changes color and the inside becomes softer and sweeter.
Plants making food is a chemical change. Plants use energy from sunlight to change air and water into food. The food is sugar. Sugar is a different type of matter than air or water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.

Select the one substance that is not a mineral.

Choices:
A. Native gold is a solid. It is a pure substance.
B. A turtle shell is made by a living thing. It is a solid.
C. Magnetite is a pure substance. It is formed in nature.

Answer:","B
Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
A turtle shell is made by a living thing. But minerals are not made by living things.

During peer review, you read and respond to a fellow student's writing. While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:
Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?
Voice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?
Sentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?The writer could best improve his or her sentence fluency by varying sentence length.
For example, the writer could combine the underlined groups of short sentences to create longer ones.

B. If Janice prefers a keyboard with the Dvorak layout, she can use mine. In my opinion, it's faster than typing on a keyboard with a QWERTY layout.

Answer:","A
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

Question:
Based on this information, what is this scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype for the flower color gene?

Hint:
In a group of scarlet rosemallow plants, some individuals have red flowers and others have white flowers. In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele F is for red flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers.
A certain scarlet rosemallow plant from this group has white flowers. This plant has two alleles for white flowers.

Choices:
A. white flowers
B. ff

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The scarlet rosemallow plant has two alleles for white flowers (f). So, the plant's genotype for the flower color gene is ff."

Select the one substance that is not a mineral.

Choices:
A. Malachite is a solid. It is formed in nature.
B. Shampoo is a liquid. It is made in a factory.
C. Quartz is a pure substance. It is formed in nature.

Answer:","B
Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.

Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. Though Mr. Nelson loved the old house's charming kitchen, it was in serious need of repair.
B. The old house was in serious need of repair, but Mr. Nelson loved its charming kitchen.

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
breaking a piece of glass
tying a shoelace

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","A
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Breaking a piece of glass is a physical change. The glass gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.
Tying a shoelace is a physical change. The shoelace gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
shaking up salad dressing
using a large magnet to remove pieces of iron from a junkyard

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","A
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Shaking up salad dressing is a physical change. The different parts mix together, but they are still made of the same type of matter.

What is the mass of a bicycle?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 25 ounces
B. 25 tons
C. 25 pounds

Answer:","C
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton.The best estimate for the mass of a bicycle is 25 pounds.
25 ounces is too light and 25 tons is too heavy."

Marco starts to pull the wagon across the yard. To move the wagon at the same speed each time, which friend does Marco need to pull with a larger force?

Hint:
Marco gives two friends a ride in his wagon. One friend sits in the wagon at a time.

Choices:
A. a friend who weighs 28 pounds
B. a friend who weighs 35 pounds

Answer:","B
A force is a push or a pull.
A force can make an object start moving or stop an object that is moving. A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.
Forces can be different sizes.
Think about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object.Look for the friend who is heavier.
A friend who weighs 35 pounds is heavier than a friend who weighs 28 pounds. So, to move the wagon at the same speed each time, Marco needs to use a larger force to start moving the wagon with a friend who weighs 35 pounds."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
President Zimmerman is an effective communicator, because he has a natural talent for speaking with people.

Choices:
A. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
B. ad hominem: a personal attack against one's opponent

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that President Zimmerman is an effective communicator because he communicates well. However, the ""evidence"" is just a restatement of the claim itself. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as circular reasoning."

Question:
Compare the motion of two mountain bikers. Which mountain biker was moving at a higher speed?

Choices:
A. a mountain biker who moved 170kilometers in 5hours
B. a mountain biker who moved 125kilometers in 5hours

Answer:","A
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed.Look at the distance each mountain biker moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One mountain biker moved 170 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other mountain biker moved 125 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each mountain biker spent the same amount of time moving. The mountain biker who moved 170 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that mountain biker must have moved at a higher speed."

Question:
Does this passage describe the weather or the climate?
The air pressure is often low in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Choices:
A. climate
B. weather

Answer:","A
The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures.Read the text carefully.
The air pressure is often low in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Air pressure is caused by the weight of the air in the atmosphere. When the air pressure is low, the sky is usually cloudy.

Last year, there were seven men's clothing stores on Main Street in Sparrowtown. This year, there are only three. What probably happened to the overall supply of men's shirts in Sparrowtown?

Choices:
A. The supply probably went down.
B. The supply probably went up.

Answer:","A
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.When four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, the number of suppliers went down. There were fewer stores selling men's shirts. So, the supply of men's shirts probably went down."

B. Dear Dr. Novak,

Answer:","B
A letter starts with a greeting and ends with a closing. For each one, capitalize the first word and end with a comma. You should also capitalize proper nouns, such as Aunt Sue.
Dear Aunt Sue,
I'm glad you could come to my party, and
thank you for the birthday gift. I could not have
asked for a better one! Every time I see it, I think
of you.
With love,
RoryThe first greeting is correct:
Its first word is capitalized, and it ends with a comma. Dr. Novak is capitalized because it is a proper noun."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
breaking a ceramic plate
beating an egg

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","D
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.
Beating an egg is a physical change. Beating an egg mixes together the egg white, egg yolk, and some air. But mixing them together does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Using only these supplies, which question can Vicky investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Vicky leaves a glass jar of cold tea outside in full sunlight. When she goes to get it, she notices that the tea is warm. She wonders what factors affect how warm a liquid gets from sitting in the sunlight. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
two identical glass jars
two jar lids
tap water
a measuring cup
two thermometers

Choices:
A. When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a glass jar or eight ounces of water in a plastic cup get warmer?
B. When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a closed jar or eight ounces of water in an open jar get warmer?
C. Will eight ounces of carbonated water or eight ounces of tap water get warmer when placed in a jar in the sun?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","A
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Peeling a banana is a physical change. The peel is not covering the rest of the fruit anymore. But both the peel and the banana are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
The thing that makes Carson stand out as a remarkable cellist is that he's a marvelous musician who plays the cello splendidly.

Choices:
A. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
B. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
C. ad hominem: an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Carson is a remarkable cellist because he plays the cello well. However, the ""evidence"" is just a restatement of the claim itself. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as circular reasoning."

Last year, 50,000 people lived in the city of Washington. But since then, 8,000 people have moved away. What probably happened to the overall supply of houses for sale in Washington?

Choices:
A. The supply probably went up.
B. The supply probably went down.

Answer:","A
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.The population of Washington fell by 8,000 people. Many of the people who have left are probably trying to sell their houses. Since more people are trying to sell their houses, the number of suppliers of houses for sale in Washington has gone up.

Question:
Which pencil has a higher temperature?

Hint:
Two pencils are identical except for their thermal energies.

Choices:
A. the pencil with more thermal energy
B. the pencil with less thermal energy

Answer:","A
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two pencils are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the pencil with more thermal energy has a higher temperature."

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Arietta has one allele for straight fur (F) and one allele for wavy fur (f). So, Arietta's genotype for the fur texture gene is Ff."

A certain Channel catfish from this group has the homozygous genotype bb for the body color gene.

Choices:
A. a white body

Answer:","A

An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The Channel catfish's genotype for the body color gene is bb. The Channel catfish's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for a white body. So, the Channel catfish's phenotype for the body color trait must be a white body.
To check this answer, consider whether the Channel catfish's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a brown body (B) is dominant over the allele for a white body (b). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
The Channel catfish's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the Channel catfish's phenotype for the body color trait must be a white body."

B. Last winter, Jordan took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, he just missed a few of his college friends, who had been in Florida the previous week.

Answer:","A
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The first text uses ironic in its traditional sense: contrary to what was intended, often in an amusing way. It's ironic because Jordan tried to get away from the snow but found himself in a snowstorm regardless.
Last winter, Jordan took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week.
The second text uses ironic in its nontraditional sense: marked by coincidence. It was a coincidence that Jordan's friends were in Florida the week before.
Last winter, Jordan took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, he just missed a few of his college friends, who had been in Florida the previous week.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
erosion caused by wind
breaking a piece of glass

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","D
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Erosion caused by wind is a physical change. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock. But the pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter.
Breaking a piece of glass is a physical change. The glass gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

Question:
Which sentence is more formal?

Choices:
A. Customers should respond to this email ASAP.
B. Customers should respond to this email at their earliest convenience.

Answer:","B
Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples
slang | cool, awesome
idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store
contractions | can't, won't
Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses abbreviated language (ASAP).
The first sentence does not use abbreviated language, so it is more formal."

Poets often use the sounds of words to create interesting effects and to express moods and emotions. Understanding these elements of poetry can help you better interpret and appreciate poetic forms.
Anaphora is the repetition of words or sequences of words at the beginning of multiple phrases, sentences, or lines.
Out of the cradle endlessly rocking,
Out of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,
Out of the Ninth-month midnight
—From Walt Whitman, ""Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds. Often, assonance can create rhymes or near-rhymes within lines.
I wandered lonely as a Cloud
That floats on high o'er Vales and Hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host of golden Daffodils.
—From William Wordsworth, ""I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud""
Meter is a poem's rhythm, or the pattern of strong and weak syllables. Strong syllables are stressed, while weak syllables are unstressed.
A poem has an iambic meter when the beat sounds like da-DUM. A weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Occasionally, a line may begin with a strong syllable.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
A poem has a trochaic meter when the beat sounds like DUM-da. A strong syllable is followed by a weak syllable. Occasionally, a line may end in a strong syllable.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
—From Edgar Allen Poe, ""The Raven""
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.This poem uses alliteration. It repeats beginning consonant sounds.

Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. The Doyles' car has a dent in the bumper, but otherwise their car looks just like the Shens'.
B. The Doyles' car looks just like the Shens', but theirs has a dent in the bumper.

Answer:","B
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

Choices:
A. no
B. yes

Answer:","A
A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.
There are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:
Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily since we have a concert in two weeks.This is not a run-on sentence. It is not formed from two sentences that have been run together without appropriate punctuation.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
rust forming on a metal gate
a piece of pear turning brown

Choices:
A. Both are caused by heating.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","C
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
A piece of a pear turning brown is a chemical change. The substances in the pear react with oxygen in the air and turn into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown part of the pear, the inside will still be white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the pear.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Which sugar cube has more thermal energy?

Hint:
Two sugar cubes are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. the hotter sugar cube
B. the colder sugar cube

Answer:","A
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two sugar cubes are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter sugar cube has more thermal energy."

Question:
Select the one substance that is not a mineral.

Choices:
A. Muscovite is not made by living things. It is a solid.
B. Sterling silver is not a pure substance. It is a solid.
C. Native copper is not made by living things. It is a solid.

Answer:","B
Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Sterling silver is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
So, sterling silver is not a mineral.
Muscovite is a mineral.
Native copper is a mineral."

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Is the following trait inherited or acquired?
Gavin has a scar on his right ankle.

Hint:
Hint: Most scars are caused by accidents during a person's life.

Choices:
A. inherited
B. acquired

Answer:","B
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits.Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt.

Question:
Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. John washed the windshield of his car even though he knew it would just get dirty again.
B. John washed the windshield of his car even though he knew the car would just get dirty again.

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun it could refer to the windshield or the car.
The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. It has been replaced with the car.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
The two authors of this study claim that social media can be healthy for adolescents. However, neither author attended a top-ranked medical school, so you can't trust their research.

Choices:
A. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
B. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
C. ad hominem: an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself

Answer:","C
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that the two authors' research on adolescents and social media can't be trusted because neither author attended a top-ranked medical school. This is a personal attack on the authors' qualifications that isn't relevant to whether their research is valid. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as ad hominem."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
a sidewalk heating up in the sun
water vapor condensing on a bathroom mirror

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","A
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
A sidewalk heating up in the sun is a physical change. The temperature of the sidewalk goes up, but the sidewalk is still made of the same type of matter.
Water vapor condensing on a bathroom mirror is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The water changes state from gas in the air to liquid water on the mirror. But the water vapor and the liquid water are both made of water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
A sidewalk getting warm in the sun is caused by heating. But water vapor condensing is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Water vapor condensing is caused by cooling. But a sidewalk heating up in the sun is not."

B. Everyone seemed to enjoy the magnolia-scented candle, but Manuel found the smell rather nauseous.

Answer:","B
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The first text uses nauseous in its traditional sense: causing disgust or nausea.

Answer:","B
Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.
How do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.

Question:
Based on this information, what is this pea plant's genotype for the pea color gene?

Hint:
In a group of pea plants, some individuals have yellow peas and others have green peas. In this group, the gene for the pea color trait has two alleles. The allele E is for yellow peas, and the allele e is for green peas.
A certain pea plant from this group has green peas. This plant has two alleles for green peas.

Choices:
A. ee
B. green peas

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The pea plant has two alleles for green peas (e). So, the plant's genotype for the pea color gene is ee."

Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.

Choices:
A. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Candice.
B. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Candice.

Answer:","B
A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.To determine if there is a net force on Candice, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Candice down with a force of 600 N.
The seat of the cart is pushing Candice up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Candice."

"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
water evaporating from a lake
cooking a pancake

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","B
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Cooking a pancake is a chemical change. Pancakes are made from pancake batter. A cooked pancake is a different type of matter than pancake batter. Pancake batter is wet and slippery. Cooked pancakes are fluffy and can be good to eat!
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Water evaporating is a physical change. But cooking a pancake is not.
Both are chemical changes.
Cooking a pancake is a chemical change. But water evaporating from a lake is not.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Bagheera's phenotype for the fur color trait?

Hint:
In a group of Bengal tigers, some individuals have orange fur and others have white fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele F is for orange fur, and the allele f is for white fur.
Bagheera, a Bengal tiger from this group, has white fur. Bagheera has two alleles for white fur.

Choices:
A. white fur
B. ff

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Bagheera's observable version of the fur color trait is white fur. So, Bagheera's phenotype for the fur color trait is white fur."

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 4 hours

Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. Tucker bought a program for the opera without realizing that the program was in Russian.
B. Tucker bought a program for the opera without realizing that it was in Russian.

Answer:","B
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

Choices:
A. hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations
B. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
C. slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

Choices:
A. The supply went up.
B. The supply went down.

Answer:","A
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.The cotton gin was a new technology that made it possible to harvest cotton much faster than before. Cotton growers were able to produce much more cotton in the same amount of time. So, the supply of cotton went up."

Question:
Based on this information, what is this fruit fly's genotype for the wing type gene?

Hint:
This passage describes the wing type trait in fruit flies:

In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele N is for normal wings, and the allele n is for vestigial wings.
A certain fruit fly from this group has normal wings. This fly has one allele for normal wings and one allele for vestigial wings.

Choices:
A. Nn
B. normal wings

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The fruit fly has one allele for normal wings (N) and one allele for vestigial wings (n). So, the fly's genotype for the wing type gene is Nn."

An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Ace's genotype for the horns gene is hh. Ace's genotype of hh has only h alleles. The h allele is for having horns. So, Ace's phenotype for the horns trait must be having horns.
To check this answer, consider whether Ace's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Ace's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Ace's phenotype for the horns trait must be having horns."

a tree to hang the feeders from

Choices:
A. Do the squirrels eat walnuts from large feeders more often than from small feeders?
B. Do the squirrels select sunflower seeds or walnuts more often?
C. Which type of tree do the squirrels feed from most often?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Dominic is standing on a diving board at the pool. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Dominic with a force of 400N. The diving board is pushing up on Dominic with a force of 400N.

Choices:
A. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Dominic.
B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Dominic.

Answer:","B
A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.To determine if there is a net force on Dominic, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Dominic down with a force of 400 N.
The diving board is pushing Dominic up with a force of 400 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 400 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Dominic."

A simple sentence is a sentence with only one subject and predicate.
The pitcher threw the ball to first base.
A compound sentence is two simple sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
The pitcher threw the ball, and the batter hit it.
Some simple sentences have a compound subject or a compound predicate, but they are not compound sentences.
Anna and James will watch the fireworks tonight.
This simple sentence has a compound subject, Anna and James.
The singers bowed and walked off the stage.
This simple sentence has a compound predicate, bowed and walked off the stage.
Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but they are not compound sentences. The introductory phrase is part of the predicate.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
No one in your family surfs? But I thought you said you lived in California before this.

Choices:
A. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
B. hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that a person from California must have a surfer in his or her family. However, even though some people in California surf, that doesn't necessarily mean that every family has a surfer. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a hasty generalization."
"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Complete the sentence.
Deep-frying chicken is a ().

Choices:
A. chemical change
B. physical change

Answer:","A
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.Deep-frying chicken is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the chicken to change. Cooked chicken and raw chicken are different types of matter."
"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
cooking an egg
burning food on a stove

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","A
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked eggs and raw eggs are made of different types of matter.
Food burning on a stove is a chemical change. The type of matter in the food changes. The food turns black and gives off smoke.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.

Question:
Choose the poem that uses anaphora.

Hint:
From H. Lavinia Baily, ""Myself and You"" and from Ezra Pound, ""The Sea of Glass""

Choices:
A. I looked and saw a sea
roofed over with rainbows,
In the midst of each
two lovers met and departed.
B. There are only myself and you in the world,
There are only myself and you;
'Tis clear, then, that I unto you should be kind,
And that you unto me should be true.

Answer:","B
Poets often use the sounds of words to create interesting effects and to express moods and emotions. Understanding these elements of poetry can help you better interpret and appreciate poetic forms.
Anaphora is the repetition of words or sequences of words at the beginning of multiple phrases, sentences, or lines.
Out of the cradle endlessly rocking,
Out of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,
Out of the Ninth-month midnight
—From Walt Whitman, ""Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds. Often, assonance can create rhymes or near-rhymes within lines.
I wandered lonely as a Cloud
That floats on high o'er Vales and Hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host of golden Daffodils.
—From William Wordsworth, ""I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud""
Meter is a poem's rhythm, or the pattern of strong and weak syllables. Strong syllables are stressed, while weak syllables are unstressed.
A poem has an iambic meter when the beat sounds like da-DUM. A weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Occasionally, a line may begin with a strong syllable.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
A poem has a trochaic meter when the beat sounds like DUM-da. A strong syllable is followed by a weak syllable. Occasionally, a line may end in a strong syllable.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
—From Edgar Allen Poe, ""The Raven""
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.This poem uses anaphora. It repeats the same word or words at the beginning of multiple lines or phrases.

Answer:","A
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.All three mugs of cider have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 75°C mug of cider is the hottest, it has the most thermal energy."

Question:
Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. After Anna separated the walnuts from the shells, she placed them in a wooden bowl.
B. Anna placed the walnuts in a wooden bowl after she separated them from the shells.

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.

Compare the motion of three cars. Which car was moving at the lowest speed?

Choices:
A. a car that moved 530miles north in 10hours
B. a car that moved 270miles east in 10hours
C. a car that moved 585miles south in 10hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed.Look at the distance each car moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each car moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each car moved for 10 hours. The car that moved 270 miles moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that car must have moved at the lowest speed."

A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.
There are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:
Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.

Question:
Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the pea shape trait?

Hint:
In a group of pea plants, some individuals have round peas and others have wrinkled peas. In this group, the gene for the pea shape trait has two alleles. The allele for round peas (E) is dominant over the allele for wrinkled peas (e).
A certain pea plant from this group has the homozygous genotype EE for the pea shape gene.

Choices:
A. wrinkled peas
B. round peas

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The pea plant's genotype for the pea shape gene is EE. The pea plant's genotype of EE has only E allelles. The E allele is for round peas. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the pea shape trait must be round peas.
To check this answer, consider whether the pea plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for round peas (E) is dominant over the allele for wrinkled peas (e). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
The pea plant's genotype of EE has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the pea shape trait must be round peas."

Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.Floods destroyed the cough drop factories in Dover. The number of producers of cough drops went down. So, the supply of cough drops will probably go down."

Question:
Which figure of speech is used in this text?
Although David hasn't worked in years, his mother prefers to say that he's between jobs right now.

Choices:
A. euphemism
B. oxymoron

Answer:","A
Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.
A euphemism is a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.
The head of Human Resources would never refer to firing people, only to laying them off.
Hyperbole is an obvious exaggeration that is not meant to be taken literally.
I ate so much that I think I might explode!
An oxymoron is a joining of two seemingly contradictory terms.
Some reviewers are calling this book a new classic.
A paradox is a statement that might at first appear to be contradictory, but that may in fact contain some truth.
Always expect the unexpected.The text uses a euphemism, a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.
Between jobs is an indirect way of saying unemployed."

Question:
Does the sentence use a simile or a metaphor?
Pete swam with ease across the swimming pool, like a dolphin.

Choices:
A. simile
B. metaphor

Answer:","A
Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader.Pete swam with ease across the swimming pool, like a dolphin.
The words Pete and dolphin are compared using the word like. So, the sentence uses a simile."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
My opponent argues that we should abolish the soda tax. It's a shame that he wants to encourage people to eat and drink unhealthily. I say we keep it.

Choices:
A. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
B. guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
C. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

Answer:","C
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that the speaker's opponent wants to encourage unhealthy habits. However, this misrepresents the opponent's argument. The speaker's opponent only wants to remove the soda tax. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man."

Question:
According to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?

Hint:
Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
Logan is pulling on a full suitcase.

Choices:
A. The suitcase is pushing on Logan.
B. The suitcase is pulling on Logan.

Answer:","B
According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force. This means that if one object is applying a force on a second object, the second object must also be applying a force on the first object, but in the opposite direction.
For example, if your hand is pushing down on a table, the table is also pushing up on your hand. Or, if you are pulling forward on a rope, the rope is also pulling back on you.Logan is pulling on the suitcase. So, Newton's third law tells you that the suitcase is pulling on Logan."

B. Thresher sharks hatch from eggs with no shells. They have a long tail and fins. They can use their tail to hit and stun their prey. Thresher sharks live in salt water.

Answer:","A
Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.
How do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.

Question:
Complete the statement.
Titanium is ().

Hint:
Titanium is a strong, lightweight metal often used to make tennis rackets and golf clubs. The chemical formula for titanium is Ti.

Choices:
A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Answer:","B
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.You can tell whether titanium is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for titanium is Ti. This formula contains one symbol: Ti. So, the formula tells you that titanium is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, titanium is an elementary substance."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
cutting an apple
breaking a rock in half

Choices:
A. Both are caused by heating.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","B
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Cutting an apple is a physical change. The apple gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter as the uncut apple.
Breaking a rock in half is a physical change. The rock gets broken into two pieces. But the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the original rock.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters.The better estimate for the volume of a watering can is 7 liters.
7 milliliters is too little."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
photosynthesis
cooking an egg

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are chemical changes.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","B
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Photosynthesis is a chemical change. Plants make sugar using carbon dioxide, water, and energy from sunlight.
Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked egg and raw egg are different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking is caused by heating. But photosynthesis is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Which object has the most thermal energy?

Hint:
The objects are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. an orange at a temperature of 93°F
B. an orange at a temperature of 66°F
C. an orange at a temperature of 68°F

Answer:","A
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.All three oranges have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 93°F orange is the hottest, it has the most thermal energy."

Choices:
A. simple
B. compound
C. complex
D. compound-complex

Answer:","A
A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence.
the oranges on our tree are ripe
The clause can stand alone. It is independent.

The clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.
A simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.
Ben and I spent all day relaxing by the pool.
Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.
In the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.
Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw the flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard a rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.

Question:
Select the one substance that is not a mineral.

Choices:
A. Native gold is a pure substance. It is not made by living things.
B. A shark's tooth is not a pure substance. It is formed in nature.
C. Potassium feldspar is a pure substance. It is a solid.

Answer:","B
Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Native gold is a mineral.
Potassium feldspar is a mineral.
A shark's tooth is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
So, a shark's tooth is not a mineral."

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Pacha's phenotype for the fur length trait?

Hint:
In a group of cats, some individuals have short fur and others have long fur. In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f).
Pacha is a cat from this group. Pacha has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur length gene.

Choices:
A. long fur
B. short fur

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Pacha's genotype for the fur length gene is ff. Pacha's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for long fur. So, Pacha's phenotype for the fur length trait must be long fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Pacha's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Pacha's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Pacha's phenotype for the fur length trait must be long fur."

Is this a run-on sentence?
Culture plays an important role for orcas they communicate with distinct calls and live in small, intimate groups led by older females that teach the younger orcas.

Choices:
A. no
B. yes

Answer:","B
A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.
There are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:
Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.

Question:
Which wax candle has a higher temperature?

Hint:
Two 18-gram wax candles are identical except for their thermal energies.

Choices:
A. the wax candle with less thermal energy
B. the wax candle with more thermal energy

Answer:","B
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two wax candles are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the wax candle with more thermal energy has a higher temperature."

Question:
Select the plant.

Choices:
A. Mango trees have many leaves.
B. Vultures eat mammals and birds.

Answer:","A
Plants and animals are living things. Living things are called organisms.
Plants come in many shapes and sizes. Most plants grow in the ground. They might grow leaves, flowers, and fruit. Plants cannot move around on their own like animals can.
Animals also come in many shapes and sizes. Most animals can move around. Animals might run, swim, jump, or fly. Animals eat plants or other organisms for food.A vulture is an animal. It eats mammals and birds.
Vultures usually do not hunt live animals. They eat animals that are already dead! This behavior is called scavenging.
A mango tree is a plant. It has many green leaves.
Mango trees can grow to over 100 feet tall!"

Question:
Based on this information, what is Shiloh's phenotype for the fur length trait?

Hint:
In a group of dogs, some individuals have short fur and others have long fur. In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele for long fur (f) is recessive to the allele for short fur (F).
Shiloh is a dog from this group. Shiloh has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur length gene.

Choices:
A. short fur
B. long fur

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Shiloh's genotype for the fur length gene is ff. Shiloh's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for long fur. So, Shiloh's phenotype for the fur length trait must be long fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Shiloh's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for long fur (f) is recessive to the allele for short fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Shiloh's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Shiloh's phenotype for the fur length trait must be long fur."

Question:
Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. ""This morning, it said that Leah Scott won the mayoral election in Yardley,"" Steven remarked to his sister.
B. ""This morning, the newspaper said that Leah Scott won the mayoral election in Yardley,"" Steven remarked to his sister.

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.

Question:
Select the solid.

Choices:
A. pencil
B. rain puddle
C. helium
D. wet paint

Answer:","A
Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.Helium is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. Helium is lighter than air. So, if you fill a balloon with helium, the balloon will rise. If helium leaks out of the balloon, the helium will expand into the space around the balloon.
A pencil is a solid. You can break a pencil into pieces. But each piece will still have a size and shape of its own.
Wet paint is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour wet paint out of a can, the paint will change shape. But the wet paint will still take up the same amount of space.
A rain puddle is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you collect rainwater in a bucket, the rainwater will take the shape of the bucket. But the rainwater will still take up the same amount of space."

Compare the motion of two fish. Which fish was moving at a lower speed?

Choices:
A. a fish that moved 5kilometers in 10hours
B. a fish that moved 30kilometers in 10hours

Answer:","A
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.Look at the distance each fish moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One fish moved 5 kilometers in 10 hours.
The other fish moved 30 kilometers in 10 hours.
Notice that each fish spent the same amount of time moving. The fish that moved 5 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that fish must have moved at a lower speed."

Trichlorofluoromethane is ().

Hint:
Trichlorofluoromethane was once used in refrigerators and fire extinguishers. It is no longer used because it harms the atmosphere's ozone layer. The chemical formula for trichlorofluoromethane is CCl3F.

Choices:
A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Answer:","A
There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether trichlorofluoromethane is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for trichlorofluoromethane, CCl3 F, contains three atomic symbols: C for carbon, Cl for chlorine, and F for fluorine. So, the formula tells you that trichlorofluoromethane is composed of three chemical elements bonded together.
Since trichlorofluoromethane is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, trichlorofluoromethane is a compound."

An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux.The source of the allusion Panglossian is literature.
In Voltaire's 1759 novel Candide, Pangloss is a tutor whose worldview is relentlessly upbeat to the point of excessive optimism.
The allusion Panglossian means unreasonably positive."

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Choices:
A. physical change
B. chemical change

Answer:","B
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, ice melting is a physical change. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. Silver jewelry tarnishing is a chemical change. The silver reacts with sulfur in the air to form black tarnish. The tarnish is a different type of matter that was not there before the change."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Edna investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Edna wants to grow sunflowers in her backyard garden. She notices that some sunflowers grow much taller than others. She is curious about what factors affect how sunflowers grow. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
seeds from one type of sunflower
soil
one wooden planter box in the sun
one wooden planter box in the shade
one plastic planter box in the sun
water

Choices:
A. Do sunflowers grow taller if they are planted in planter boxes or in pots?
B. Do sunflowers grow bigger in sunny planter boxes or in shady planter boxes?
C. Which type of sunflower grows more leaves?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Chemicals in a battery reacting to power a flashlight is a ().

Choices:
A. chemical change
B. physical change

Answer:","A
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.Chemicals in a battery reacting to power a flashlight is a chemical change.

using a large magnet to remove pieces of iron from a junkyard

Choices:
A. Both are caused by heating.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","D
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Mixing sand and gravel is a physical change. Together, the sand and gravel make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Using a large magnet to remove pieces of iron from a junkyard is a physical change. Both the iron and the magnet are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

B. a motorboat that moved 115kilometers east in 5hours
C. a motorboat that moved 280kilometers north in 5hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed.Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each motorboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each motorboat moved for 5 hours. The motorboat that moved 115 kilometers moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at the lowest speed."

C. by punctuating the quotation correctly

Answer:","B
During peer review, you read and respond to a fellow student's writing. While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:
Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?
Voice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?
Sentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?The writer could best improve his or her grammar and mechanics by using semicolons correctly.
For example, the writer could use semicolons before the conjunctive adverb therefore in the first underlined sentence, to separate items in a series containing commas in the second underlined sentence, and instead of a comma to separate main clauses in the third underlined sentence.

B. Neuroscientists have discovered that sleep has more than just restorative functions. For example, it plays a significant role in strengthening and solidifying memories.

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.

Question:
Which letter opening is more formal?

Choices:
A. Dear Mr. Boyer,
B. Dear Andrew,

Answer:","A
Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners.The first letter opening is more formal. It uses the recipient's personal title and last name. The other opening uses the recipient's first name, suggesting a more familiar relationship."

What information supports the conclusion that Diane inherited this trait?

Hint:
Read the description of a trait.
Diane has naturally black hair.

Choices:
A. Some people use a hair dryer to straighten their hair. But Diane and her brothers have naturally straight hair.
B. Both of Diane's biological parents have naturally black hair.
C. When she was younger, Diane wore ribbons in her naturally black hair.

Answer:","B
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. If Lila's skirt doesn't match the blouse, she will have to exchange the blouse for another item.
B. If Lila's skirt doesn't match the blouse, she will have to exchange it for another item.

Answer:","B
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that Matthew's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between Matthew and Earth () as he rode the escalator.

Hint:
Read the text about a person in motion.
Matthew rode an escalator from the first floor to the second floor of a shopping mall.

Choices:
A. increased
B. stayed the same
C. decreased

Answer:","A
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between Matthew and the center of Earth changed.
The second floor is higher than the first floor. As he rode the escalator toward the second floor, the distance between Matthew and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between Matthew and Earth increased as he rode the escalator."

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:

B. When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a closed jar or eight ounces of water in an open jar get warmer?
C. When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a glass jar or eight ounces of water in a plastic cup get warmer?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
baking a loaf of bread
burning a candle

Choices:
A. Both are caused by heating.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","A
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. The type of matter in the dough changes when it is baked. The dough turns into bread!
Burning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn. They react with oxygen in the air and turn into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.

B. Each vase and bowl in Beth's collection of handmade pottery is unique. The colors and designs reflect both her cultural heritage and her individual artistic style.

Answer:","B
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The second text uses unique in its traditional sense: being the only one of its kind.
Each vase and bowl in Beth's collection of handmade pottery is unique. The colors and designs reflect both her cultural heritage and her individual artistic style.
The first text uses unique in its nontraditional sense: interesting or unusual. Beth is a distinctive artist, but might not be one of a kind. It may be helpful to remember that if unique is modified by an adverb—as in most unique, very unique, or quite unique—it is probably being used nontraditionally.

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","D
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Cutting a piece of rope is a physical change. The rope is shorter after you cut it. But it is still made of the same type of matter as the uncut rope.

Wingding, a budgerigar parakeet from this group, has green body feathers. Wingding has two alleles for green body feathers.

Choices:
A. green body feathers
B. BB

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Wingding has two alleles for green body feathers (B). So, Wingding's genotype for the body feather color gene is BB."

B. a ship that moved 85kilometers north in 5hours
C. a ship that moved 335kilometers south in 5hours

Answer:","C
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed.Look at the distance each ship moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each ship moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each ship moved for 5 hours. The ship that moved 335 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that ship must have moved at the highest speed."

Question:
Complete the statement.
Calcium is ().

Hint:
Calcium is a metal found in substances that make up your teeth and bones. The chemical formula for calcium is Ca.

Choices:
A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Answer:","B
There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether calcium is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for calcium contains one atomic symbol: Ca. So, the formula tells you that calcium is composed of only one chemical element.
Since calcium is composed of only one chemical element, calcium is an elementary substance."

Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.

Question:
A drought has made this year's tomato harvest smaller than usual. What will probably happen to the overall supply of tomato sauce?

Choices:
A. The supply will probably go up.
B. The supply will probably go down.

Answer:","B
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.Since the tomato harvest was smaller than usual, tomatoes will be harder to get. Because tomatoes are a resource for making tomato sauce, tomato sauce will be harder to make. So, the supply of tomato sauce will probably go down."

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
I've heard that fast food can lead to health problems, but I don't believe it. My grandpa ate fast food every day of his adult life, and he lived to be ninety-one.

Choices:
A. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
B. slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences
C. hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations

Answer:","C
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that fast food must not lead to health problems because the speaker's grandfather ate fast food every day and lived to ninety-one. However, one person's experience doesn't disprove a general pattern. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a hasty generalization."

Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

B. A lichen is composed of an alga and a fungus. Biologists name lichens based on the species of fungus.

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.The first answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun they is used without its antecedent.
The second answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. They has been replaced with biologists.
A lichen is composed of an alga and a fungus. Biologists name lichens based on the species of fungus."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Senator Bowen announced today that she plans to cut funding to early childhood education programs. The last thing we need is a government official who hates children!

Choices:
A. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
B. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Senator Bowen hates children, because she wants to cut education funding. However, the fact that Senator Bowen wants to cut education funding doesn't necessarily suggest that she hates children. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man."

Question:
Does the sentence use a simile or a metaphor?
Erin went down the slide face-first, like a penguin.

Choices:
A. metaphor
B. simile

Answer:","B
Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader.Erin went down the slide face-first, like a penguin.
The words Erin and penguin are compared using the word like. So, the sentence uses a simile."

Question:
Assume all other forces on the train are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on the train?

Hint:
A train is sitting on a magnetic track. Earth's gravity is pulling down on the train with a force of 200,000N. The magnetic track is pushing up on the train with a force of 200,000N.

Choices:
A. The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the train.
B. The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the train.

Answer:","B
A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.To determine if there is a net force on the train, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling the train down with a force of 200,000 N.
The magnetic track is pushing the train up with a force of 200,000 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 200,000 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the train."

Is there a surplus or a shortage of apple juice?

Hint:
A bottle of apple juice costs $3. The grocery store has 80 bottles for sale. At that price, 50 people want to buy one.

Choices:
A. shortage
B. surplus

Answer:","B
There is a surplus if there is too much for sale at a given price.
There is a shortage if there is not enough for sale at a given price.
Surpluses and shortages usually happen when people who are selling goods or services charge too much or too little.
When the price is too high, consumers will not want to buy much of the good or service. The quantity demanded will be less than the quantity supplied. So, there will be a surplus.
When the price is too low, too many consumers will want to buy the good or service. The quantity demanded will be more than the quantity supplied. So, there will be a shortage.At the current price, there are too many bottles of apple juice for sale. There are 80 bottles for sale, but only 50 people want to buy one.
So, there is a surplus of apple juice. The grocery store will not get any money for the leftover bottles."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
a slice of banana turning brown
burning a marshmallow over a campfire

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","D
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The part of the banana in contact with the air reacts with oxygen and turns into a different type of matter.
Burning a marshmallow is a chemical change. The heat from the fire causes the type of matter in the marshmallow to change. The marshmallow becomes black and crispy.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.

Question:
Based on this information, what is Peaches's phenotype for the leg color trait?

Hint:
In a group of chickens, some individuals have white legs and others have yellow legs. In this group, the gene for the leg color trait has two alleles. The allele for white legs (L) is dominant over the allele for yellow legs (l).
Peaches is a chicken from this group. Peaches has the homozygous genotype ll for the leg color gene.

Choices:
A. white legs
B. yellow legs

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Peaches's genotype for the leg color gene is ll. Peaches's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for yellow legs. So, Peaches's phenotype for the leg color trait must be yellow legs.
To check this answer, consider whether Peaches's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for white legs (L) is dominant over the allele for yellow legs (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Peaches's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Peaches's phenotype for the leg color trait must be yellow legs."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
I ate kielbasa right before my favorite football team won the championship back in 2006. Now, I always eat kielbasa before their games to carry them to victory.

Choices:
A. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
B. false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that eating kielbasa before games makes the team win. However, even though the writer ate kielbasa before his or her team won in 2006, that doesn't necessarily mean that the kielbasa was responsible for the team's success. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as false causation."

Question:
How long is an ice skate?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 33 meters
B. 33 centimeters

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.The better estimate for the length of an ice skate is 33 centimeters.
33 meters is too long."

Present tense verbs tell you about something that is happening now.
Most present-tense verbs are regular. They have no ending, or they end in -s or -es.
Two verbs are irregular in the present tense, to be and to have. You must remember their forms.
Past tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.
Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.
Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.
Future tense verbs tell you about something that is going to happen.
All future-tense verbs use the word will.
Present | Past | Future

Question:
What is the mass of an elephant?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 4 pounds
B. 4 ounces
C. 4 tons

Answer:","C
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton.The best estimate for the mass of an elephant is 4 tons.
4 ounces and 4 pounds are both too light."

In a group of cats, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a hairy body, and the allele b is for a hairless body.
Cookie, a cat from this group, has a hairy body. Cookie has two alleles for a hairy body.

Choices:
A. BB
B. a hairy body

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Cookie has two alleles for a hairy body (B). So, Cookie's genotype for the body hair gene is BB."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
crushing a mineral into powder
mixing lettuce and salad dressing

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","A
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Mixing lettuce and salad dressing is a physical change. Together, the salad and dressing make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Compare the motion of two bats. Which bat was moving at a lower speed?

Choices:
A. a bat that moved 95kilometers in 5hours
B. a bat that moved 115kilometers in 5hours

Answer:","A
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.Look at the distance each bat moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One bat moved 95 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other bat moved 115 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each bat spent the same amount of time moving. The bat that moved 95 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that bat must have moved at a lower speed."

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Question:
What is the volume of a kiddie pool?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 255 fluid ounces
B. 255 gallons
C. 255 cups

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon.The best estimate for the volume of a kiddie pool is 255 gallons.
255 fluid ounces and 255 cups are both too little."

Question:
Which bowl of cereal has a higher temperature?

Hint:
Two bowls of cereal are identical except for their thermal energies.

Choices:
A. the bowl of cereal with more thermal energy
B. the bowl of cereal with less thermal energy

Answer:","A
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two bowls of cereal are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the bowl of cereal with more thermal energy has a higher temperature."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Sofia investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Sofia gets a basketball for her birthday and dribbles it around her neighborhood. She notices that sometimes the ball bounces higher than other times. She wonders what factors affect how high her ball bounces. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
one basketball
access to a brick patio
access to a grassy lawn
access to a gravel driveway
a meterstick

Choices:
A. Does the basketball bounce higher on a lawn or on a dirt path?
B. Does the basketball bounce higher on gravel or on grass?
C. Do larger basketballs bounce higher than smaller basketballs on a brick patio?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
How could Lexi have anything insightful to say about foreign affairs? She grew up on a farm.

Choices:
A. hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations
B. straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
C. ad hominem: an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself

Answer:","C
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Lexi cannot be insightful about foreign affairs because she grew up on a farm. This is a personal attack that isn't relevant to whether she knows about foreign affairs. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as ad hominem."

Question:
Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the pea shape trait?

Hint:
In a group of pea plants, some individuals have round peas and others have wrinkled peas. In this group, the gene for the pea shape trait has two alleles. The allele for round peas (E) is dominant over the allele for wrinkled peas (e).
A certain pea plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ee for the pea shape gene.

Choices:
A. round peas
B. wrinkled peas

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The pea plant's genotype for the pea shape gene is ee. The pea plant's genotype of ee has only e alleles. The e allele is for wrinkled peas. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the pea shape trait must be wrinkled peas.
To check this answer, consider whether the pea plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for round peas (E) is dominant over the allele for wrinkled peas (e). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
The pea plant's genotype of ee has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the pea shape trait must be wrinkled peas."

Compare the motion of two speedboats. Which speedboat was moving at a lower speed?

Choices:
A. a speedboat that moved 460miles in 10hours
B. a speedboat that moved 555miles in 10hours

Answer:","A
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.Look at the distance each speedboat moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One speedboat moved 460 miles in 10 hours.
The other speedboat moved 555 miles in 10 hours.

There are 1,000 grams in 1 kilogram. So, 1 gram is much less than 1 kilogram.
A paper clip has a mass of about 1 gram, while a textbook has a mass of about 1 kilogram.The better estimate for the mass of a guitar is 3 kilograms.
3 grams is too light."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
getting a haircut
cracking open a peanut

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","A
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Getting a haircut is a physical change. Your hair is shorter after a haircut. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Cracking open a peanut is a physical change. The peanut shell breaks and the peanut falls out. Both are still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Which is a simple sentence?

Choices:
A. Mr. Keller's afternoon lecture was about art and culture in Germany before World War II.
B. I can review the draft of your story unless you're still editing it.

Answer:","A
A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought. It can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause is not a complete thought. It cannot stand alone as a sentence.
the oranges on our tree are ripe
The clause can stand alone. It is independent.

Question:
Which mug of cocoa has a lower temperature?

Hint:
Two 100-gram mugs of cocoa are identical except for their thermal energies.

Choices:
A. the mug of cocoa with less thermal energy
B. the mug of cocoa with more thermal energy

Answer:","A
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two mugs of cocoa are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the mug of cocoa with less thermal energy has a lower temperature."

Question:
The Fourth Amendment protects people against ""unreasonable searches."" Which is an example of the type of ""unreasonable search"" this amendment protects against?

Choices:
A. A teacher asks a student to answer a hard question in front of the class.
B. A parent spends several hours trying to find a lost set of car keys.
C. A police officer looks through a student's backpack for no reason.

Answer:","C
The Fourth Amendment says that ""unreasonable searches"" are not allowed. It is not always clear what makes a search ""unreasonable."" But a search for no reason is definitely unreasonable! For example, a police officer cannot look through a student's backpack for no reason. The police officer has to have some sort of reason. Police officers and other government employees search people every day. There are many good reasons the government might have to search someone. For example, the person might be acting in a suspicious or strange way. Or a police officer might see something against the law before the search. It is often hard to know if the government has a good enough reason to do a search. Often a judge will have to decide. The full text of the Fourth Amendment is below. How can a police officer or other member of the government get the right to search someone? The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."

Question:
Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. Steven's brother Jim wondered whether he ran fast enough to qualify for the Boston Marathon.
B. Steven's brother Jim wondered whether Steven ran fast enough to qualify for the Boston Marathon.

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.

"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
How long is a garden rake?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 2 kilometers
B. 2 meters

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.The better estimate for the length of a garden rake is 2 meters.

During this chemical reaction, the solution becomes ().

Hint:
When a chemical reaction absorbs or releases thermal energy, the reaction causes a change in temperature. Read the passage about a chemical reaction that absorbs or releases thermal energy. Then, follow the instructions below.
Dutch chocolate is a special type of chocolate that has a dark color and a mild flavor. It is made by treating chocolate with a solution of water and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). When sodium hydroxide dissolves in water, sodium ions (Na+) and hydroxide ions (OH−) form in the solution. During this process, chemical energy is converted to thermal energy, which flows into the surroundings.

Choices:
A. colder
B. warmer

Answer:","B
During a chemical reaction, thermal energy is absorbed or released as heat. This transfer of thermal energy changes the temperature of the reaction's surroundings. The surroundings are everything around the reaction, such as the solution that the reaction takes place in or the air nearby.
Some reactions release thermal energy into the surroundings. This thermal energy is converted from chemical energy, which is provided by the molecules in the reaction. As the thermal energy moves out of the reaction and into the surroundings, the temperature of the surroundings increases.
Some reactions absorb thermal energy from the surroundings. This thermal energy is converted into chemical energy during the reaction. As the thermal energy moves out of the surroundings and into the reaction, the temperature of the surroundings decreases.To determine whether the solution becomes warmer or colder, look for the text that describes the movement of thermal energy during the reaction.Dutch chocolate is a special type of chocolate that has a dark color and a mild flavor. It is made by treating chocolate with a solution of water and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). When sodium hydroxide dissolves in water, sodium ions (Na+) and hydroxide ions (OH−) form in the solution. During this process, chemical energy is converted to thermal energy, which flows into the surroundings.The underlined text tells you that thermal energy flows into the surroundings. Because thermal energy moves out of the reaction and into the surroundings, the temperature of the surroundings increases.The surroundings include the solution that the reaction takes place in. So, the solution becomes warmer."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
mixing sand and water
picking up a paper clip with a magnet

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","D
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Mixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Picking up a paper clip with a magnet is a physical change. The paper clip sticks to the magnet, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

The city of Princeton has been one of the world's biggest makers of cough drops for many years. But last month, Princeton's cough drop factories were destroyed by floods. What will probably happen to the overall supply of cough drops?

Choices:
A. The supply will probably go up.
B. The supply will probably go down.

Answer:","B
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.Floods destroyed the cough drop factories in Princeton. The number of producers of cough drops went down. So, the supply of cough drops will probably go down."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
an old sandwich rotting in a trashcan
milk going sour

Choices:
A. Both are caused by heating.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are caused by cooling.

Answer:","C
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
A sandwich rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the sandwich breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.
Milk going sour is a chemical change. The type of matter in the milk slowly changes. The new matter that is formed gives the milk its sour taste.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

A. Mossy frogs get the energy they need to live by eating insects. The frogs capture insects with their tongues.
B. Sphagnum mosses get the energy they need to live from sugars. The mosses make these sugars from carbon dioxide and water.

Answer:","B
Organisms that carry out photosynthesis are called photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, these organisms use light energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce sugars and oxygen.
Photosynthetic organisms also often have the following characteristics:
They are producers, which are organisms that make their own food inside their cells. Because producers make their own food, they typically do not eat other organisms.
Their cells contain chloroplasts, which are cell structures where photosynthesis occurs.
Their chloroplasts often contain a green substance called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll captures light energy from the Sun to power photosynthesis.
They use the sugars they produce during photosynthesis as food. This food provides energy that helps the organisms live, grow, and reproduce.This organism is photosynthetic:
The text tells you that Sphagnum mosses get energy from the sugars they make using carbon dioxide and water. This is evidence that the Sphagnum moss is a photosynthetic organism.

a clothesline in the laundry room
a clothesline in the backyard

Choices:
A. Do cloth towels dry faster if they are hung in the laundry room or in the backyard?
B. Does a small cloth towel or a large cloth towel dry faster when hung in the backyard?
C. When hung in the laundry room, do black cloth towels or white cloth towels dry more quickly?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Based on this information, what is this fly's phenotype for the eye color trait?

Hint:
In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have red eyes and others have brown eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for red eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for brown eyes (e).
A certain fruit fly from this group has the homozygous genotype ee for the eye color gene.

Choices:
A. brown eyes
B. red eyes

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.The fruit fly's genotype for the eye color gene is ee. The fruit fly's genotype of ee has only e alleles. The e allele is for brown eyes. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the eye color trait must be brown eyes.
To check this answer, consider whether the fruit fly's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for red eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for brown eyes (e). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
The fruit fly's genotype of ee has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the eye color trait must be brown eyes."

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Since Fairfax College receives more applications for admission than Newton University, Fairfax College is evidently a better school.

Choices:
A. ad hominem: an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
B. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
C. slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Which figure of speech is used in this text?
When Jayden finally agreed to let his daughter adopt the stray dog, she responded with a smile that was a mile wide.

Choices:
A. hyperbole
B. oxymoron

Answer:","A
Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.
A euphemism is a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.
The head of Human Resources would never refer to firing people, only to laying them off.
Hyperbole is an obvious exaggeration that is not meant to be taken literally.
I ate so much that I think I might explode!
An oxymoron is a joining of two seemingly contradictory terms.
Some reviewers are calling this book a new classic.
A paradox is a statement that might at first appear to be contradictory, but that may in fact contain some truth.

Question:
Which tray of lasagna has less thermal energy?

Hint:
Two trays of lasagna are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. the hotter tray of lasagna
B. the colder tray of lasagna

Answer:","B
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 1-kilogram brick at 70°F has half as much thermal energy as a 2-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the smaller brick has half as many atoms. So, it has half as much thermal energy.The two trays of lasagna are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder tray of lasagna has less thermal energy."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Michelle has no school spirit—she never comes to any of our football games.

Choices:
A. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
B. ad hominem: a personal attack against one's opponent

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Michelle doesn't have school spirit, because she doesn't go to football games. However, there may be a number of reasons why Michelle doesn't go to football games. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy."

Question:
Based on this information, what is Peanut's phenotype for the body hair trait?

Hint:
In a group of deer mice, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairless body (b) is recessive to the allele for a hairy body (B).
Peanut is a deer mouse from this group. Peanut has the heterozygous genotype Bb for the body hair gene.

Choices:
A. a hairy body
B. a hairless body

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Peanut's phenotype for the body hair trait. First, consider the alleles in Peanut's genotype for the body hair gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a hairless body (b) is recessive to the allele for a hairy body (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Peanut's genotype of Bb has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Peanut's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairy body."

Which text uses the word terribly in its traditional sense?

Choices:
A. Sally made escargots using the small snails from her garden. She prepared them according to the recipe but found the chewy texture terribly disappointing.
B. Sally decided to make escargots using the small snails from her garden, but she prepared them terribly. Since she'd forgotten to add garlic, the taste was disappointing.

Answer:","B
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The first text uses terribly in its traditional sense: in a terrible manner.
Sally decided to make escargots using the small snails from her garden, but she prepared them terribly. Since she'd forgotten to add garlic, the taste was disappointing.

Question:
Select the elementary substance.

Choices:
A. bromomethane (CH3Br)
B. ammonia (NH3)
C. gold (Au)

Answer:","C
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for ammonia contains two symbols: N for nitrogen and H for hydrogen. So, ammonia is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, ammonia is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for bromomethane contains three symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, and Br for bromine. So, bromomethane is made of three chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, bromomethane is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for gold contains one symbol: Au. So, gold is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, gold is an elementary substance."

B. a speedboat that moved 390kilometers east in 5hours
C. a speedboat that moved 330kilometers south in 5hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed.Look at the distance each speedboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each speedboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each speedboat moved for 5 hours. The speedboat that moved 390 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that speedboat must have moved at the highest speed."

Answer:","A
A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.
There are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:
Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily since we have a concert in two weeks.This is not a run-on sentence. It is not formed from two sentences that have been run together without appropriate punctuation.

A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object.To determine if there is a net force on Jennifer, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Jennifer down with a force of 600 N.
The seat of the cart is pushing Jennifer up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Jennifer."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
an antacid tablet reacting with water
a penny tarnishing

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","D
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
An antacid tablet reacting with water is a chemical change. When the tablet touches water, the type of matter in the tablet changes and carbon dioxide gas is released. This gas makes the water fizz.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
I'm never setting foot in any seafood restaurant again. We just had a ridiculously overpriced dinner at Cameron's Seafood Hut, and I have no interest in repeating that experience.

Choices:
A. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
B. hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that all seafood restaurants are overpriced. However, even though one seafood restaurant was overpriced, that doesn't necessarily mean that all seafood restaurants are overpriced. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a hasty generalization."

Based on this information, what is Smudge's phenotype for the body hair trait?

Hint:
In a group of cats, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairless body (b) is recessive to the allele for a hairy body (B).
Smudge is a cat from this group. Smudge has the homozygous genotype bb for the body hair gene.

Choices:
A. a hairless body
B. a hairy body

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.Smudge's genotype for the body hair gene is bb. Smudge's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for a hairless body. So, Smudge's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairless body.
To check this answer, consider whether Smudge's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a hairless body (b) is recessive to the allele for a hairy body (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Smudge's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Smudge's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairless body."

Question:
Select the part whose main job is to sort and package proteins and other substances in a plant cell.

Choices:
A. nucleus
B. cell wall
C. mitochondria
D. Golgi

Answer:","D
Plant cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.
Some cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:
Chloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.
The nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.
After proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.
In plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.
Other cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.
The cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.
On the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.
The cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts.The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances for the cell. The Golgi sends some of these substances to parts of the cell where they are needed. It sends other substances to the cell membrane, where they are released from the cell."

Question:
What is the mass of an elephant?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 3 tons
B. 3 ounces
C. 3 pounds

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton.The best estimate for the mass of an elephant is 3 tons.

"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Complete the sentence.
Melting wax is a ().

Choices:
A. chemical change
B. physical change

Answer:","B
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.Melting wax is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid. But it is still made of the same type of matter."

Question:
Compare the motion of two sailboats. Which sailboat was moving at a lower speed?

Choices:
A. a sailboat that moved 65kilometers in 5hours
B. a sailboat that moved 90kilometers in 5hours

Answer:","A
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.Look at the distance each sailboat moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One sailboat moved 65 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other sailboat moved 90 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each sailboat spent the same amount of time moving. The sailboat that moved 65 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that sailboat must have moved at a lower speed."

My friends walk along the path.
A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma.

To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.

How long is a basketball court?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

B. 22 meters

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?

Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.The better estimate for the length of a basketball court is 22 meters.

Question:
Select the one substance that is not a mineral.

Choices:
A. A turtle shell is not a pure substance. It is made by a living thing.
B. Celestine is a pure substance. It is a solid.
C. Hematite is not made by living things. It is a solid.

Answer:","A
Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
A turtle shell is made by a living thing. But minerals are not made by living things.
A turtle shell is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
So, a turtle shell is not a mineral.
Celestine is a mineral.
Hematite is a mineral."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
an old sandwich rotting in a trashcan
a piece of apple turning brown

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","D
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
A sandwich rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the sandwich breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.
A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Question:
Which sentence uses a metaphor?

Choices:
A. Her laughter was like a bird's song.
B. Her laughter was a bird's song.

Answer:","B
Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader.This sentence uses a metaphor:
Her laughter was a bird's song.
The words laughter and bird's song are compared without the word like or as.

Compare the motion of two geese. Which goose was moving at a higher speed?

Choices:
A. a goose that moved 430kilometers in 10hours
B. a goose that moved 440kilometers in 10hours

Answer:","B
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed.Look at the distance each goose moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One goose moved 440 kilometers in 10 hours.
The other goose moved 430 kilometers in 10 hours.

Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.A baseball cap is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. If you put a baseball cap on your head, the baseball cap will still have a size and shape of its own.
The air inside a tire is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air in a tire expands to fill all the space inside the tire. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the tire.
Rain is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you put rainwater into a bucket, the rainwater will take the shape of the bucket. But the rainwater will still take up the same amount of space.
A ring is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A ring keeps its shape, even when you take it off your finger."

Question:
Which sales pitch is more formal?

Choices:
A. Find crazy good gifts every time.
B. Find the perfect gift for every occasion.

Answer:","B
Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners.The first sales pitch is more formal. It uses more elevated language (perfect gift for every occasion). The other sales pitch uses slang (crazy good)."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
The school requires us to be on time. If you can't even obey this rule, then what's to stop you from doing something worse, like stealing?

Choices:
A. slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences
B. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
C. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that being late to school will lead to becoming a thief. However, this argument wrongly suggests that the inability to follow a rule about being on time to school will necessarily lead to the breaking of other rules. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as the slippery slope fallacy."

What is the mass of an eraser?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 39 grams
B. 39 kilograms

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using metric units, mass may be written with units of grams or kilograms.

Is the following trait inherited or acquired?
Kimberly has naturally straight hair.

Choices:
A. inherited
B. acquired

Answer:","A
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits.Some humans are born with naturally straight hair. Others are born with naturally curly hair. Straight and curly are examples of hair texture.
Some people use tools to change how their hair looks. But this doesn't affect the natural texture of their hair. So, having naturally straight hair is an inherited trait."

B. Liz is excellent in her position as class treasurer. She always manages to be disinterested in student council debates about the allocation of extracurricular funds.

Answer:","B
Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.The first text uses disinterested in its traditional sense: unbiased or impartial.
Liz is excellent in her position as class treasurer. She always manages to be disinterested in student council debates about the allocation of extracurricular funds.
The second text uses disinterested in its nontraditional sense: uninterested or indifferent.

All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.The two cherry pies have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 90°F pie is hotter than the 85°F pie, it has more thermal energy."

Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. As John was walking with his friend Bob, Bob tripped on the uneven sidewalk.
B. As John was walking with his friend Bob, he tripped on the uneven sidewalk.

Answer:","B
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:

When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that the scoop of ice cream's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the scoop of ice cream and Earth () as the ice cream dropped toward the ground.

Hint:
Read the text about an object in motion.
Jason was holding an ice cream cone with two scoops of mint chip ice cream. When he licked the ice cream, a scoop fell off and dropped to the ground.

Choices:
A. stayed the same
B. increased
C. decreased

Answer:","C
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the scoop of ice cream and the center of Earth changed.
The ground was lower than the ice cream cone. As the scoop of ice cream fell toward the ground, the distance between the scoop and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the scoop of ice cream and Earth decreased as the ice cream dropped toward the ground."

All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Asgore's phenotype for the coat color trait. First, consider the alleles in Asgore's genotype for the coat color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Asgore's genotype of Ll has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Asgore's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."

Question:
The students start rolling their backpacks at the same speed. Which backpack is pulled with a larger force?

Hint:
Two students get ready to leave school. The students have the same rolling backpacks. Each student has different books in her backpack.

Choices:
A. a backpack carrying 8 pounds
B. a backpack carrying 7 pounds

Answer:","A
A force is a push or a pull.
A force can make an object start moving or stop an object that is moving. A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.
Forces can be different sizes.
Think about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object.Look for the backpack that is heavier.
A backpack carrying 8 pounds is heavier than a backpack carrying 7 pounds. So, the backpack carrying 8 pounds needs to be pulled with a larger force to start rolling at the same speed as the other backpack."

What information supports the conclusion that Felipe inherited this trait?

Hint:
Read the description of a trait.
Felipe has pale skin.

Choices:
A. Felipe's parents have pale skin. They passed down this trait to Felipe.
B. Felipe and his father both have dark hair.

Answer:","A
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

Question:
Select the one animal that has all of the reptile traits listed above.

Hint:
Reptiles are a group of animals with similar traits. The following traits can be used to identify reptiles:
They have scaly, waterproof skin.
They make eggs with shells. Observe the animals and read the descriptions.

Choices:
A. Cardinalfish have scaly skin and live near coral reefs. Cardinalfish lay eggs with no shells and have fins that help them swim underwater.
B. American crocodiles often live where rivers flow into the ocean. In these places, the fresh water and salt water mix. This mixing creates the somewhat salty, or brackish, water that these crocodiles prefer. American crocodiles have scaly, waterproof skin and hatch from eggs with shells.

Answer:","B
Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.
How do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.
Reptiles have the following traits:
They have scaly, waterproof skin.
They make eggs with shells.
Compare each animal's traits to the group's traits. Select the animal with traits similar to the group's traits.
An American crocodile has the following traits:
It has scaly, waterproof skin.
It makes eggs with shells.
An American crocodile has the traits of a reptile. An American crocodile is a reptile.
A cardinalfish has the following traits:
It has fins, not limbs.
It makes eggs with no shells.

What is the mass of a skateboard?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 7 ounces
B. 7 tons
C. 7 pounds

Answer:","C
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton.The best estimate for the mass of a skateboard is 7 pounds.
7 ounces is too light and 7 tons is too heavy."

Choices:
A. hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations
B. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
C. slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

Question:
How long does it take to tie your shoes?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 25 hours
B. 25 seconds

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour.The better estimate for how long it takes to tie your shoes is 25 seconds.

Question:
Based on this information, what is this scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype for the flower color gene?

Hint:
In a group of scarlet rosemallow plants, some individuals have red flowers and others have white flowers. In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele F is for red flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers.
A certain scarlet rosemallow plant from this group has red flowers. This plant has two alleles for red flowers.

Choices:
A. red flowers
B. FF

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The scarlet rosemallow plant has two alleles for red flowers (F). So, the plant's genotype for the flower color gene is FF."

Answer:","A
Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."
"Choose an answer for the following question and give your reasons.

Question:
Select the elementary substance.

Choices:
A. silicon dioxide (SiO2)
B. palladium (Pd)
C. carbon dioxide (CO2)

Answer:","B
Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for silicon dioxide contains two symbols: Si for silicon and O for oxygen. So, silicon dioxide is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, silicon dioxide is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for palladium contains one symbol: Pd. So, palladium is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, palladium is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for carbon dioxide contains two symbols: C for carbon and O for oxygen. So, carbon dioxide is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, carbon dioxide is a compound, not an elementary substance."

Question:
Is there a surplus or a shortage of hats?

Hint:
A store has 20 new hats for sale. The hats cost $35 each. At that price, 15 people want to buy one.

Choices:
A. shortage
B. surplus

Answer:","B
There is a surplus if there is too much for sale at a given price.
There is a shortage if there is not enough for sale at a given price.
Surpluses and shortages usually happen when people who are selling goods or services charge too much or too little.
When the price is too high, consumers will not want to buy much of the good or service. The quantity demanded will be less than the quantity supplied. So, there will be a surplus.
When the price is too low, too many consumers will want to buy the good or service. The quantity demanded will be more than the quantity supplied. So, there will be a shortage.At the current price, there are too many hats for sale. There are 20 hats for sale, but only 15 people want to buy one.

Question:
Complete the sentence.
Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is a ().

Choices:
A. chemical change
B. physical change

Answer:","A
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is a chemical change. Bread is made up mostly of a chemical called starch. Saliva breaks the bonds between atoms in the starch molecules.

Two gold bars have the same temperature but different masses. Which gold bar has more thermal energy?

Hint:
The objects are made of the same type of matter.

Choices:
A. the gold bar with less mass
B. the gold bar with more mass

Answer:","B
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two gold bars have the same temperature and are made of the same type of matter. So, the gold bar with more mass has more thermal energy."

B. Emma and her sister posed for a photograph, but when the flash went off, she blinked.

Answer:","B
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun she could refer to Emma or her sister.
The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. She has been replaced with Emma.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Alana's shoes are superior, because they're made from one hundred percent snakeskin, not synthetic materials.

Choices:
A. red herring: the use of a completely unrelated topic or idea
B. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Alana's shoes are the best, because they're made with snakeskin rather than synthetic materials. However, even though the shoes are made from snakes, that doesn't necessarily mean that they are better. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as an appeal to nature."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
mixing chocolate syrup into milk
water vapor condensing on a bathroom mirror

Choices:
A. Both are caused by heating.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","B
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Mixing chocolate syrup into milk is a physical change. The chocolate syrup and milk make a mixture. Making a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Water vapor condensing on a bathroom mirror is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The water changes state from gas in the air to liquid water on the mirror. But the water vapor and the liquid water are both made of water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Water vapor condensing is caused by cooling. But mixing chocolate syrup into milk is not."

Question:
How long is a long-distance running race?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 26 kilometers
B. 26 millimeters
C. 26 centimeters
D. 26 meters

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.
A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length.The best estimate for the length of a long-distance running race is 26 kilometers.

B. Hippopotamuses have small hairs near their mouths and ears, but most of their skin is hairless. Their skin makes a reddish-brown substance that acts like sunscreen! Hippopotamuses give birth to live offspring.

Answer:","B
Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.
How do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.
Placental mammals have the following traits:
They give birth to live offspring.
They have fur or hair.

Question:
Which stick of butter has less thermal energy?

Hint:
Two sticks of butter are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. the colder stick of butter
B. the hotter stick of butter

Answer:","A
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two sticks of butter are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder stick of butter has less thermal energy."

Based on this information, what is Clyde's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?

Hint:
In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a).
Clyde is a cow from this group. Clyde has the heterozygous genotype Aa for the coat pattern gene.

Choices:
A. white spots
B. solid coloring

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Clyde's phenotype for the coat pattern trait. First, consider the alleles in Clyde's genotype for the coat pattern gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Clyde's genotype of Aa has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Clyde's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring."

Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?
Voice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?
Sentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?The writer could best improve his or her academic voice by avoiding subjective statements.
For example, the writer could cut the underlined text to maintain an objective discussion of human cloning.
Cloning has come a long way since a sheep named Dolly was successfully cloned in 1996. Now it is becoming possible to use cloning for a variety of purposes. For example, cloning technology could be used to grow stem cells from which replacement organs, such as hearts and livers, could be grown. If a person became ill and needed an organ transplant, cloning could provide the answer. With advances in technology, even cloning humans has become a distinct possibility. Scientists, bioethicists, and governments are all exploring this, even though it is clearly unnatural and unethical."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
chicken cooking in an oven
baking an apple pie

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","B
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Cooking chicken is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the chicken to change. Cooked chicken and raw chicken are different types of matter.
Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes when it is baked. The crust turns brown, and the apples become soft.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that the gecko's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the gecko and Earth () as the gecko crawled on the window.

Hint:
Read the text about an animal in motion.
A gecko used its sticky feet to crawl from the bottom of a window to the top of the window.

Choices:
A. stayed the same
B. decreased
C. increased

Answer:","C
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the gecko and the center of Earth changed.
The top of the window is higher than the bottom of the window. As the gecko crawled toward the top of the window, the distance between the gecko and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the gecko and Earth increased as the gecko crawled on the window."

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

What is the source of the allusion in the sentence below?
Lee described the situation he was facing with his boss as a catch-22.

Choices:
A. literature
B. a song

Answer:","A
An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux.The source of the allusion catch-22 is literature.
Joseph Heller coined the term ""catch-22"" in his 1961 novel of the same name. In the novel, if an army pilot wants to avoid dangerous missions, he must be deemed mentally unfit; however, his desire to stay safe proves his sanity, so he can never be excused from a mission. Heller called this sort of predicament or dilemma a catch-22.
The allusion catch-22 means a no-win situation."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Hazel never lies. She told me herself, so it must be true.

Choices:
A. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
B. red herring: the use of a completely unrelated topic or idea

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Hazel is telling the truth because she says she never lies. However, the ""evidence"" is just a restatement of the claim itself. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as circular reasoning."

Question:
How long is an ice skate?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 31 centimeters
B. 31 meters

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer.The better estimate for the length of an ice skate is 31 centimeters.

chemicals in a battery reacting to power a flashlight

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are caused by heating.
D. Both are only physical changes.

Answer:","A
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Chemicals in a battery reacting to power a flashlight is a chemical change. When the flashlight is turned on, the chemicals in the battery react with each other to form new chemicals. This creates electricity, which powers the lightbulb.

Question:
Select the one animal that has all of the bony fish traits listed above.

Hint:
Bony fish are a group of animals with similar traits. The following traits can be used to identify bony fish:
They have fins, not limbs.
They live underwater.
They have a skeleton made of bone.
They make eggs with no shells. Observe the animals and read the descriptions.

Choices:
A. Wels catfish have a bony skeleton and live in lakes, rivers, and coastal waters. Wels catfish eggs do not have shells for protection. Male catfish guard the eggs until they hatch.
B. Gray tree frogs hatch from eggs without shells. They live underwater when they are tadpoles. They move onto land when they become adults. The moist skin of adult gray tree frogs can be green or gray. The color of their skin helps them hide on rocks or plants.

Answer:","A
Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.
How do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.
Bony fish have the following traits:
They have fins, not limbs.
They live underwater.
They have a skeleton made of bone.
They make eggs with no shells.
Compare each animal's traits to the group's traits. Select the animal with traits similar to the group's traits.
A gray tree frog has the following traits:
It spends part of its life in water and part on land.
It has moist skin.
It makes eggs with no shells.
A gray tree frog does not have all of the traits of a bony fish. A gray tree frog is an amphibian.
A wels catfish has the following traits:
It has fins, not limbs.
It lives underwater.
It has a skeleton made of bone.
It makes eggs with no shells.
A wels catfish has the traits of a bony fish. A wels catfish is a bony fish."

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that the book's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the book and Earth () as the book fell toward the ground.

Hint:
Read the text about an object in motion.
Harold knocked a book off a bookshelf. The book fell to the ground.

Choices:
A. decreased
B. stayed the same
C. increased

Answer:","A
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the book and the center of Earth changed.
The ground is lower than the bookshelf. As the book fell toward the ground, the distance between the book and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the book and Earth decreased as the book fell toward the ground."

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
How could Mia have anything insightful to say about foreign affairs? She grew up on a farm.

Choices:
A. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
B. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
C. ad hominem: an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself

Answer:","C
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Mia cannot be insightful about foreign affairs because she grew up on a farm. This is a personal attack that isn't relevant to whether she knows about foreign affairs. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as ad hominem."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
pouring milk on oatmeal
sewing an apron

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are caused by heating.
C. Both are only physical changes.
D. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","C
Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Pouring milk on oatmeal is a physical change. The oatmeal and milk form a creamy mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric and thread that make up the apron get a new shape, but the type of matter in each of them does not change.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

a box of matches

Choices:
A. Do candles with thick wicks or with thin wicks produce more smoke?
B. Do large candles or small candles produce more smoke?
C. Do scented candles or unscented candles produce more smoke?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Based on this information, what is Candy's phenotype for the albinism trait?

Hint:
This passage describes the albinism trait in rats:

In a group of rats, some individuals have albinism and others do not. In this group, the gene for the albinism trait has two alleles. The allele for not having albinism (A) is dominant over the allele for having albinism (a).
Candy is a rat from this group. Candy has the heterozygous genotype Aa for the albinism gene.

Choices:
A. not having albinism
B. having albinism

Answer:","A
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Candy's phenotype for the albinism trait. First, consider the alleles in Candy's genotype for the albinism gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for not having albinism (A) is dominant over the allele for having albinism (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Candy's genotype of Aa has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Candy's phenotype for the albinism trait must be not having albinism."

Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down from biological parents to their offspring through genes. Genes are pieces of hereditary material that contain the instructions that affect inherited traits. Offspring receive their genes, and therefore gain their inherited traits, from their biological parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Parents do not pass acquired traits down to their offspring."

The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Squirt's phenotype for the tail spots trait. First, consider the alleles in Squirt's genotype for the tail spots gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.
Squirt's genotype of Ii has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Squirt's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be a spotted tail."

Question:
What is the volume of a washing machine?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 40 gallons
B. 40 fluid ounces
C. 40 cups

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon.The best estimate for the volume of a washing machine is 40 gallons.
40 fluid ounces and 40 cups are both too little."

Question:
Select the one substance that is not a mineral.

Choices:
A. Sphalerite is a pure substance. It is not made by living things.
B. Steel is made in a factory. It is not a pure substance.
C. Pyrite is formed in nature. It is not made by living things.

Answer:","B
Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Steel is made in a factory. But all minerals are formed in nature.
Steel is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.

Question:
Complete the statement.
Hydrogen fluoride is ().

Hint:
Hydrogen fluoride is used to make chemicals that can help keep refrigerators cool. The chemical formula for hydrogen fluoride is HF.

Choices:
A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Answer:","A
There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether hydrogen fluoride is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for hydrogen fluoride, HF, contains two atomic symbols: H for hydrogen and F for fluorine. So, the formula tells you that hydrogen fluoride is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since hydrogen fluoride is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, hydrogen fluoride is a compound."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
water evaporating from a puddle
dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas

Choices:
A. Both are caused by cooling.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are chemical changes.

Answer:","B
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.
Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Officer, I was only driving as fast as everyone around me. I'm sure I wasn't speeding.

Choices:
A. appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
B. bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct

Answer:","B
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that the speaker wasn't driving over the speed limit, because she was driving at the same speed as those around her. However, even though everyone was driving the same speed, that doesn't necessarily mean that they weren't driving over the speed limit. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as the bandwagon fallacy."

Question:
Which is a complete sentence?

Choices:
A. Mom kisses Kimberly's cheek Kimberly smiles at Mom.
B. The class chuckles at Ms. Joseph's joke.

Answer:","B
A sentence is a group of words that forms a complete thought. It has both a subject and a verb.
My friends walk along the path.
A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma.
I knocked on the door it opened.
It started raining, we ran inside.
To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
I knocked on the door, and it opened.
It started raining, so we ran inside.The class chuckles at Ms. Joseph's joke is a complete sentence. The subject is the class, and the verb is chuckles."

Question:
Would you find the word rhythm on a dictionary page with the following guide words?
rent - rotten

Choices:
A. no
B. yes

Answer:","B
Guide words appear on each page of a dictionary. They tell you the first word and last word on the page. The other words on the page come between the guide words in alphabetical order.
To put words in alphabetical order, put them in order by their first letters. If the first letters are the same, look at the second letters. If the second letters are the same, look at the third letters, and so on.
If one word is shorter, and there are no more letters to compare, then the shorter word comes first in alphabetical order. For example, be comes before bed.Put the words in alphabetical order.
Since rhythm is between the guide words rent - rotten, it would be found on that page."

Question:
Compare the motion of three ducks. Which duck was moving at the lowest speed?

Choices:
A. a duck that moved 430miles east in 10hours
B. a duck that moved 525miles north in 10hours
C. a duck that moved 555miles north in 10hours

Answer:","A
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed.Look at the distance each duck moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each duck moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each duck moved for 10 hours. The duck that moved 430 miles moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that duck must have moved at the lowest speed."

Question:
Which object has less thermal energy?

Hint:
The objects are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. an 800-gram rock at a temperature of 270°F
B. an 800-gram rock at a temperature of 250°F

Answer:","B
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.The two rocks have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 250°F rock is colder than the 270°F rock, it has less thermal energy."

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that the ball's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the ball and Earth () as the ball rolled along the lane.

Hint:
Read the text about an object in motion.
Gabrielle went bowling with some friends. She rolled her ball along the flat bowling lane toward the pins.

Choices:
A. decreased
B. increased
C. stayed the same

Answer:","C
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the ball and the center of Earth changed.
Because the bowling lane was flat, each point on the lane was the same distance from the center of Earth. As the ball rolled along the lane, the distance between the ball and the center of Earth stayed the same. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the ball and Earth stayed the same as the ball rolled along the lane."

Question:
How long is a soccer field?

Hint:
Select the better estimate.

Choices:
A. 385 inches
B. 385 feet

Answer:","B
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 8 long. You might be thinking, 8 what? Is the pencil 8 inches long? 8 feet? 8 miles?
The number 8 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are inches. So, the length of the pencil is 8 inches.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 1 inch is much shorter than 1 foot.
There are 3 feet in 1 yard. So, 1 foot is shorter than 1 yard.The better estimate for the length of a soccer field is 385 feet.

Hint:
When a chemical reaction absorbs or releases thermal energy, the reaction causes a change in temperature. Read the passage about a chemical reaction that absorbs or releases thermal energy. Then, follow the instructions below.
Pickling is used to prevent foods such as meat and vegetables from spoiling too soon. Food that has been pickled may remain edible for more than a year! One type of pickling involves soaking the food in a solution of water and sodium chloride (NaCl). When sodium chloride is dissolved in water, sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl−) form in the solution. During this process, a small amount of thermal energy is taken in from the surroundings.

Choices:
A. colder
B. warmer

Answer:","A
During a chemical reaction, thermal energy is absorbed or released as heat. This transfer of thermal energy changes the temperature of the reaction's surroundings. The surroundings are everything around the reaction, such as the solution that the reaction takes place in or the air nearby.
Some reactions release thermal energy into the surroundings. This thermal energy is converted from chemical energy, which is provided by the molecules in the reaction. As the thermal energy moves out of the reaction and into the surroundings, the temperature of the surroundings increases.
Some reactions absorb thermal energy from the surroundings. This thermal energy is converted into chemical energy during the reaction. As the thermal energy moves out of the surroundings and into the reaction, the temperature of the surroundings decreases.To determine whether the solution becomes warmer or colder, look for the text that describes the movement of thermal energy during the reaction.Pickling is used to prevent foods such as meat and vegetables from spoiling too soon.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
I'm not surprised, frankly, that someone who gets lost in his own neighborhood would argue that New York has better pizza than Chicago.

Choices:
A. ad hominem: a personal attack against one's opponent
B. circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that people who like New York pizza are likely to have a poor sense of direction. This is a personal attack that isn't relevant to which type of pizza is better. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as ad hominem."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
saliva breaking down a piece of bread
silver jewelry tarnishing

Choices:
A. Both are chemical changes.
B. Both are only physical changes.
C. Both are caused by cooling.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","A
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is a chemical change. Bread is made up mostly of a chemical called starch. Saliva breaks the bonds between atoms in the starch molecules.
The atoms then link together to form smaller, simpler molecules of sugar. The sugar is a different type of matter than the starch.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. Silver jewelry tarnishing is a chemical change. The silver reacts with sulfur in the air to form black tarnish. The tarnish is a different type of matter that was not there before the change.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.

Question:
Which object has the most thermal energy?

Hint:
The objects are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. a cookie at a temperature of 45°F
B. a cookie at a temperature of 65°F
C. a cookie at a temperature of 80°F

Answer:","C
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.All three cookies have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 80°F cookie is the hottest, it has the most thermal energy."

Question:
What do these two changes have in common?
rust forming on a metal gate
photosynthesis

Choices:
A. Both are only physical changes.
B. Both are caused by cooling.
C. Both are chemical changes.
D. Both are caused by heating.

Answer:","C
Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.
Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Photosynthesis is a chemical change. Plants make sugar using carbon dioxide, water, and energy from sunlight.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

Cutting an apple is a ().

Choices:
A. chemical change
B. physical change

Answer:","B
Chemical changes and physical changes are two ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. The paper changes into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same.
Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.
Ice melting is also a physical change. When ice melts, it changes from a solid to a liquid. But both ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water! This kind of change is called a change of state.Cutting an apple is a physical change. The apple gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter as the uncut apple."

Question:
Last year, there were seven men's clothing stores on Main Street in Winchester. This year, there are only three. What probably happened to the overall supply of men's shirts in Winchester?

Choices:
A. The supply probably went down.
B. The supply probably went up.

Answer:","A
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.When four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, the number of suppliers went down. There were fewer stores selling men's shirts. So, the supply of men's shirts probably went down."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Lacey investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Lacey gets a basketball for her birthday and dribbles it around her neighborhood. She notices that sometimes the ball bounces higher than other times. She wonders what factors affect how high her ball bounces. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
one basketball
access to a brick patio
access to a grassy lawn
access to a gravel driveway
a meterstick

Choices:
A. Do larger basketballs bounce higher than smaller basketballs on a brick patio?
B. Does the basketball bounce higher on a lawn or on a dirt path?
C. Does the basketball bounce higher on gravel or on grass?

Answer:","C
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

Choices:
A. Bella had witnessed a crime, so she made a call to report it. They promptly dispatched police to investigate the scene.
B. Bella had witnessed a crime, so she made a call to report it. The operator promptly dispatched police to investigate the scene.

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.

Question:
Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Kamal, you didn't vote in the last election, so you clearly have no regard for the democracy in which we live.

Choices:
A. false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
B. red herring: the use of a completely unrelated topic or idea

Answer:","A
A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
The text argues that Kamal must not care about democracy, because he didn't vote in the election. However, there may be a number of reasons why Kamal didn't vote in the election. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy."

Which sentence is more formal?

Choices:
A. Dana didn't enter student politics until her junior year.
B. Dana did not enter student politics until her junior year.

Answer:","B
Formal writing is used for essays, business letters, and reports. The following types of informal language should be avoided in formal writing:
Type | Examples
slang | cool, awesome
idioms | knock your socks off
conversational language | gonna, kinda, yeah
abbreviated language | ASAP, FYI
overly simple or imprecise language | he got some stuff at the store
contractions | can't, won't
Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
The first sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses a contraction (didn't).

When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.The first answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun she could refer to Mrs. Goodman or her friend.
Mrs. Goodman told her friend that she needs to exercise on a regular basis and get more sleep in order to have more energy throughout the day.
The second answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.

Answer:","B
All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.The two cherry pies have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 130°F pie is hotter than the 100°F pie, it has more thermal energy."

Based on this information, what is this Nile tilapia fish's phenotype for the body color trait?

Hint:
In a group of Nile tilapia fish, some individuals have a greenish-brown body and others have a pink body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a greenish-brown body, and the allele b is for a pink body.
A certain Nile tilapia fish from this group has a pink body. This fish has two alleles for a pink body.

Choices:
A. bb
B. a pink body

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles.

Question:
Based on this information, what is Cotton's phenotype for the fur texture trait?

Hint:
In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight fur and others have wavy fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
Cotton is a Syrian hamster from this group. Cotton has the heterozygous genotype Ff for the fur texture gene.

Choices:
A. wavy fur
B. straight fur

Answer:","B
All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.You need to determine Cotton's phenotype for the fur texture trait. First, consider the alleles in Cotton's genotype for the fur texture gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Cotton's genotype of Ff has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Cotton's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be straight fur."

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton.The best estimate for the mass of a passenger airplane is 41 tons.

Using only these supplies, which question can Zoe investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Zoe leaves a glass jar of cold tea outside in full sunlight. When she goes to get it, she notices that the tea is warm. She wonders what factors affect how warm a liquid gets from sitting in the sunlight. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
two identical glass jars
two jar lids
tap water
a measuring cup
two thermometers

Choices:
A. When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a glass jar or eight ounces of water in a plastic cup get warmer?
B. When placed in the sun, will eight ounces of water in a closed jar or eight ounces of water in an open jar get warmer?
C. Will eight ounces of carbonated water or eight ounces of tap water get warmer when placed in a jar in the sun?

Answer:","B
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Question:
Which block of iron has more thermal energy?

Hint:
Two 1-kilogram blocks of iron are identical except for their temperatures.

Choices:
A. the hotter block of iron
B. the colder block of iron

Answer:","A
Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.The two blocks of iron are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter block of iron has more thermal energy."

Question:
Complete the statement. Assume that the motorcycle's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the motorcycle and Earth () as Lamar rode up the hill.

Hint:
Read the text about an object in motion.
Lamar rode his motorcycle from the bottom of a hill to the top of the hill.

Choices:
A. decreased
B. increased
C. stayed the same

Answer:","B
Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the motorcycle and the center of Earth changed.
The top of the hill is higher than the bottom of the hill. As Lamar rode toward the top of the hill, the distance between the motorcycle and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the motorcycle and Earth increased as Lamar rode up the hill."

Compare the motion of two bowhead whales. Which bowhead whale was moving at a lower speed?

Choices:
A. a bowhead whale that moved 45kilometers in 10hours
B. a bowhead whale that moved 65kilometers in 10hours

Answer:","A
An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed.Look at the distance each bowhead whale moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One bowhead whale moved 45 kilometers in 10 hours.
The other bowhead whale moved 65 kilometers in 10 hours.
Notice that each bowhead whale spent the same amount of time moving. The bowhead whale that moved 45 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that bowhead whale must have moved at a lower speed."

Question:
The city of Booneville has been one of the world's biggest makers of cough drops for many years. But last month, Booneville's cough drop factories were destroyed by floods. What will probably happen to the overall supply of cough drops?

Choices:
A. The supply will probably go up.
B. The supply will probably go down.

Answer:","B
Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.Floods destroyed the cough drop factories in Booneville. The number of producers of cough drops went down. So, the supply of cough drops will probably go down."

Using only these supplies, which question can Elizabeth investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Elizabeth likes to skip rocks at the river. She notices that some of the rocks she throws skip off the surface of the water many times, while others skip once and then sink. She wonders what factors affect how well rocks skip on the water. So, she decides to design an experiment. She has the following supplies available:
10 small flat rocks
10 large flat rocks
access to the river by her school

Choices:
A. Do small rocks or large rocks skip more times when thrown across the river?
B. Do rocks skip more times when thrown across a river or across a pond?
C. Do round rocks or flat rocks skip more times when thrown across the river?

Answer:","A
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"

Choices:
A. no
B. yes

Answer:","A
A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.
There are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:
Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily since we have a concert in two weeks.This is not a run-on sentence. It is not formed from two sentences that have been run together without appropriate punctuation.

Question:
Complete the statement.
Fluorine is ().

Hint:
Fluorine is found in chemicals that are used to make some types of waterproof clothes. The chemical formula for fluorine is F2.

Choices:
A. a compound
B. an elementary substance

Answer:","B
There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.You can tell whether fluorine is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for fluorine, F2, contains one atomic symbol: F. So, the formula tells you that fluorine is composed of only one chemical element.
Since fluorine is composed of only one chemical element, fluorine is an elementary substance."

Question:
According to Newton's third law, what other force must be happening?

Hint:
Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
Nina's foot is pushing on her car's gas pedal.

Choices:
A. The gas pedal is pushing on Nina's foot.
B. The gas pedal is pulling on Nina's foot.

Answer:","A
According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force. This means that if one object is applying a force on a second object, the second object must also be applying a force on the first object, but in the opposite direction.
For example, if your hand is pushing down on a table, the table is also pushing up on your hand. Or, if you are pulling forward on a rope, the rope is also pulling back on you.Nina's foot is pushing on the gas pedal. So, Newton's third law tells you that the gas pedal is pushing on Nina's foot."

Answer:","B
Poetry is a special kind of writing. It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.
A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel
In vest of shining white,
In coat of silver gray,
And vest of shining white.
—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, ""The Flying Squirrel""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring""This poem uses repetition. It repeats words, phrases, or lines.
I see them in Asia and in Africa."

B. When Lucy parked her scooter next to Mr. Wiley's car, she noticed that the scooter had a flat tire.

Answer:","A
When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.

Forces can be different sizes.
Think about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object.Look for the box that is heavier.
A box holding 44 pounds is heavier than a box holding 38 pounds. So, the box holding 44 pounds needs a larger force to start moving upward at the same speed as the other box."

Question:
What is the mass of a cement truck?

Hint:
Select the best estimate.

Choices:
A. 21 tons
B. 21 ounces
C. 21 pounds

Answer:","A
Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton.The best estimate for the mass of a cement truck is 21 tons.
21 ounces and 21 pounds are both too light."

It started raining, we ran inside.
To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.

Question:
Would you find the word crooked on a dictionary page with the following guide words?
company - curious

Choices:
A. no
B. yes

Answer:","B
Guide words appear on each page of a dictionary. They tell you the first word and last word on the page. The other words on the page come between the guide words in alphabetical order.
To put words in alphabetical order, put them in order by their first letters. If the first letters are the same, look at the second letters. If the second letters are the same, look at the third letters, and so on.
If one word is shorter, and there are no more letters to compare, then the shorter word comes first in alphabetical order. For example, be comes before bed.Put the words in alphabetical order.
Since crooked is between the guide words company - curious, it would be found on that page."

Question:
Using only these supplies, which question can Manuel investigate with an experiment?

Hint:
Manuel and his sister are building ramps to race their toy cars down. Manuel notices that the cars go down some of the ramps faster than others. He wonders what factors affect the cars' speed. So, he decides to design an experiment. He has the following supplies available:
two identical toy cars
a wooden ramp three feet long and two feet tall
a cardboard ramp three feet long and two feet tall

Choices:
A. Does a big toy car go down the wooden ramp faster than a small toy car?
B. Do toy cars with plastic wheels go faster down the cardboard ramp than toy cars with metal wheels?
C. Do toy cars go faster down the ramp made of wood or the ramp made of cardboard?

Answer:","C
Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. When designing an experiment, you must identify the supplies that are necessary to answer your question. In order to do this, you need to figure out what will be tested and what will be measured during the experiment.
Imagine that you are wondering if plants grow to different heights when planted in different types of soil. How might you decide what supplies are necessary to conduct this experiment?
First, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be tested, which is the independent variable. This is usually the part of the experiment that is different or changed. In this case, you would like to know how plants grow in different types of soil. So, you must have different types of soil available.
Next, you need to identify the part of the experiment that will be measured or observed, which is the dependent variable. In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.
So, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!"
